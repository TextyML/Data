He clearly adores being a dad but after almost losing his younger son, Sami, to a rare strain of meningitis earlier this year, his happy family life is something he certainly doesn\u2019t take for granted.\nSami suddenly fell ill in February, only weeks after celebrating his second birthday.\nHe spent a fortnight fighting for his life in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital after contracting Men W, a strain of meningitis most commonly associated with young people, mainly students. Luckily, Sami now appears to have made a full recovery but his son\u2019s illness is something Matt, 44, will never forget.\nMeningitis is the inflammation of the lining of the brain and the spinal cord and septicaemia is the blood poisoning form of the illness. According to the Meningitis Research Foundation, 3,200 cases of meningitis and septicaemia occur in the UK each year.\nA tenth of these turn out to be fatal and a quarter of all survivors are left with life-altering repercussions. Having witnessed how devastating the illness can be first hand, former scrum-half Matt is now desperate to raise public awareness of meningitis and together with pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline, has launched Tackle Meningitis, a campaign that is backed by the Meningitis Research Foundation and Meningitis Now.\nIts aims are twofold: to make people more familiar with the early symptoms of meningitis and aware that there are different strains of the disease.\n\u201cI wish I had known more about meningitis and what to look out for before Sami got ill,\u201d admits Matt, who also has a four-year-old son, Alex, with his wife Carolin, 31, a former model.\n\u201cPeople tend to think of the \u2018tumbler test\u2019 but before a rash there are other less well-known symptoms such as fever, vomiting, headache, limb pain, pale skin, cold hands and feet, quick breathing, neck stiffness and aversion to light.\u201d\nLooking back, Matt can see that Sami had almost all of those early symptoms. Yet when he woke up hot and uncharacteristically grumpy on that February morning, he and Carolin assumed their son had a bad cold or virus and gave him paracetamol.\nThroughout the course of the day, Sami\u2019s symptoms became more worrying. He was sick, drowsy and had what appeared to be a small seizure, something he had experienced with a temperature in the past.\nBy mid-afternoon, he also had a very faint rash on his stomach. Concerned, Matt called his private doctor, who was unable to see Sami for a few hours and advised Matt to take him to A&E.\nBy the time he was examined at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, only minutes after arriving, the very faint rash, which Matt and Carolin had assumed was a heat rash, had become something more obvious and within minutes Sami was being pumped full of antibiotics and put into an induced coma.\n\u201cWe were told he most probably had meningitis and we both felt complete disbelief,\u201d says Matt.\n\u201cWe just hadn\u2019t realised how ill he was.\u201d\nOver the next few hours, Sami was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital and with friends and family helping out with Alex, Matt and Carolin were able to stay by their desperately sick son\u2019s side.\n\u201cWhen we arrived at Great Ormond Street a doctor told me that the next 48 hours were crucial and I just kept thinking: \u2018Is our son going to die?\u2019\u201d says Matt.\n\u201cThe doctors couldn\u2019t give us any real hope and simply told us: \u2018It\u2019s up to Sami now\u2019.\u201d\nBy then the lesions covering Sami\u2019s body made it obvious he was suffering from meningitis and blood tests later revealed he had Men W. This strain is on the rise, from 22 cases in 2009 to more than 200 in the last 12 months, according to figures from the Meningitis Research Foundation.\nAs with many parents, Matt and Carolin had assumed their son was protected from the disease as he\u2019d had the Men C vaccination as a baby. However Sami had not had the Men B jab (which offers some protection against Men W) as it was not given to babies in the UK until this year.\n\u201cAll we could do was wait, which made me feel so helpless,\u201d recalls Matt, his voice trembling slightly.\n\u201cWe just stayed by Sami\u2019s side, reading to him in case he could hear us. It was almost impossible to process the fact that our little boy\u2019s life hung in the balance and there was nothing I could do.\u201d\nFortunately Sami rallied and five days into\u00a0the illness Matt and Carolin were told he had turned a corner. The next day he was brought out of his coma and although very weak, he still managed to speak.\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d says Matt.\n\u201cWe were so incredibly lucky.\u201d\nAfter a further eight days in hospital, Sami was allowed home to recover and luckily hasn\u2019t been left with any side-effects. Since Sami\u2019s illness the whole family has been vaccinated against Men W.\nLast year a programme began to immunise teenagers aged between 14 and 18 with the Men ACWY vaccine. Young people under the age of 25, particularly students who haven\u2019t been vaccinated, are being encouraged to visit their GP or health centre for a free jab.\nA particularly aggressive strain of Men W, ST-11, is now causing cases of severe illness in all age groups in the UK and Europe. Affecting young adults the most, it is relatively uncommon in children as young as Sami. Yet as Matt knows only too well, nobody is really immune.\n\u201cMeningitis can happen to anyone,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI want people, and in particular young people, to be aware of the risks and to get immunised so we can give everyone the best chance against this dreadful disease.\u201d\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "THE England rugby ace tells LUCY BENYON how his family\u2019s terrifying experience with meningitis has spurred him to back a campaign to raise awareness of a rare form of the disease.", "site": "dailyexpress", "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/729482/Rugby-Matt-Dawson-son-meningitis-charity-disease-awareness", "title": "Rugby ace Matt Dawson: I kept thinking our son was going to die"}, "5": {"text": "Telecoms - do fewer complaints mean there's less to complain about?\u00a0\nIf there's one huge monthly outlay for many of us, it's paying for our TV services, landline phones and mobiles and broadband internet.\u00a0\nAll of these forms of communication are so crucial to the way we live our daily lives but they don't come cheap. They probably represent one of the largest chunks of monthly expenditure after our mortgage/rent and electricity/gas bills.\u00a0\nAnd given how much money we are paying for all of these packages, we shouldn't ever have to put up with problems. Resolver.co.uk users regularly get in touch to tell me about issues they are suffering with bad connections, poor customer service or their bills and packages going up in price.\u00a0\nOn the flip side there was actually a recent report from UK communications regulator Ofcom that showed a decline in the number of complaints made between April and June 2016 about these sort of providers.\u00a0\nBut to me that doesn't necessarily mean there is less to complain about. It may simply mean people aren't taking the time to complain, or are finding it hard to do so.\u00a0\nI know from experience - ever since we launched Resolver to make complaining easier - that so many people are put off raising issues because they see it as wasting time, impossible to get satisfaction from big businesses and also complicated to do.\u00a0\nAnd if anyone has ever waited on hold for ages or searched fruitlessly for the right email address to contact, you'll know the frustrations that can be involved. That's exactly why we exist, to get around those problems and make life simpler for everyone with an issue to raise.\u00a0\nOur free and independent template emails do just that and we can see the benefit clearly during 2016 so far. Users of Resolver.co.uk have taken the time to raise 2,600+ issues about TV providers, 2,500+ relating to landline phones, 18,000+ about mobile networks and 14,000+ regarding internet and broadband.\u00a0\nI always remind people that they have far more power than they assume. Big companies can only continue to be big companies if they have customers.. And no-one wants to lose customers due to bad service.\u00a0\nAnd often the only time they hear or know about bad service is when people like you get in touch with them to tell them about it.\u00a0\nSo what can you do to help with that? Here's some of my key tips for dealing with communications providers when you have a problem.\nMake it clear you may leave\u00a0\nDon't wait until the last minute. Know when your contract is up - put it in a diary or calendar - and tell your provider you are thinking of leaving them. They won't want to hear that. But you have no reason to stay loyal unless they are loyal to you back with a decent deal renewal.\nUsually they will offer you some good reasons to stay a customer, especially if you provide quotes from competitors and ask them to match the prices. However, and this is key, you don't have to accept their first offer. Even if they say it is the best possible price they can give you, it isn't always. Always keep negotiating until YOU are happy.\u00a0\nCompare all the alternatives\u00a0\nEvery month, Resolver.co.uk publishes a list of the top companies for customer service to help people like you know which are the best businesses to buy from. This allows you to go off, search out other deals and decide which is right for you based on\u00a0\nprice, reviews, customer feedback and our own independent chart. There's so much competition out there today that you can sometimes find the same deal, or nearly as good, by switching provider.\nAnd that's never as much hassle these days as you believe it to be. Besides, if you can get more for your money as a 'new' customer elsewhere, then it makes total sense even if it means a few days of disruption and some phone calls and forms. That's the only way bad businesses begin to shape up, when they realise they are losing custom.\u00a0\nContact Customer Retention\u00a0\nIn every company of all shapes and sizes, there's a group of people whose one and only job is to keep you happy and keep you as a customer. Don't be afraid to speak to them and move on from Customer Services if the employee there is not giving you what you want.\nYou might even find that they will actually offer you a much better deal than the one already offered by their own colleague in another department. They have far more room to move and ultimately they do not want to lose you. Just be polite and friendly and don't demand. Simply ask for what you want and feel is the best deal and base it on quotes elsewhere or changes in your own circumstances.\u00a0\nKnow your important dates\u00a0\nAlways be careful to never to let a contract 'roll over' into a new period. Sometimes this will mean any special offers you've previously had given to you will be taken off your bill and you'll find you're paying far more with little or no way to get out of the new contract.\nAlways start way ahead of time to be able to negotiate new deals and pricing. You'd be surprised how many people forget this and not all companies will inform you of your impending contract end date or that it is time to renew. Many contracts are continuous and simply roll over unless you make the effort and act to cancel them.\nSo be careful and read all the terms and conditions carefully and check through any letters received in the post or emails arriving in your inbox that you may think are circulars or spam but are actually far more important.\u00a0\nFinally remember this: never be afraid to tell a company if you are not experiencing good enough service or the price is not right for you. You are the customer and you deserve the best. Now go out and get what you're entitled to and that's simply the best deal possible for you personally.\u00a0\n\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "JAMES WALKER, the consumer champion helping you resolve your consumer complaints, talks about telecoms complaints.

An accelerometer built into each AirPod detects when you\u2019re speaking, enabling the microphones to focus on the sound of your voice, filtering out external noise.\nBecause these new headphones do not include any wires \u2013 they need a battery and, with the ultra-efficient Apple W1 chip powering them, they pack some five hours of battery life for audio playback.\nApple AirPod headphones ship with a companion charging case, that lets you top-up the wireless headphones with an additional 24 hours of battery life.\nIf you fancy a pair they will set you back \u00a3159, which includes the AirPods and charging case.\n\u00a0has got our hands on an early pre-production pair of AirPods from Apple, and have been using them regularly for the past few weeks.\nAirPods are incredibly impressive.\nThe Apple wireless headphones are comfortable to wear, easy to set-up and sound good.\nFor such a diddy device the battery life is also reasonably good and the charging case will give them a boost when they run low.\nOn the negative side, not everyone is going to like the design as, until people get use to them, they do look a bit odd.\nAnd we have noticed some slight interference with the sound at busy train stations (we are however testing an early review pair and not a finished product).\nAt \u00a3159 the AirPods aren't cheap but, we've got a feeling when they do finally launch, they are going to be hugely popular.\u00a0\n", "tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "APPLE has delayed its highly-anticipated bluetooth headphones \u2013 AirPods \u2013 until 2017, according to the latest rumours from the iPhone manufacturer's supply chain.", "site": "dailyexpress", "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/728860/AirPods-UK-Release-Date-Update-Apple-Headphones", "title": "AirPods Release Date - This new update is NOT good news for Apple fans "}, "29": {"text": "Apple finally lifted the lid on its all-new Macbook at a major event in Cupertino last week.\nThis powerful new laptop is packed with upgrades including a faster processor, brighter display and much slimmer design.\nHowever, unlike most of its rivals, one thing that Apple has decided not to include is an interactive touchscreen.\nInstead, the US tech firm has opted for a unique Touch Bar which replaces the function keys that usually run across the top of the MacBook Pro keyboard.\nFeaturing a clever\u00a0multi-touch Retina display, the Touch Bar changes to the app you're using \u2013 bringing interactive ways to adjust or browse through content.\nFor example, loading the Safari web browser triggers the Touch Bar to summon a slew of helpful shortcuts, including on-screen buttons to load new tabs, search the page, or refresh the page.\nNow Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Philip Schiller, has revealed why the company has avoided a touchscreen.\nSpeaking to the Independent Schiller said: \"The Mac from the very first has had a menu bar fixed at the top. It\u2019s core to the identity and the experience you get. But iOS doesn\u2019t have a menu at the top.

It\u2019s not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad.\"\nAlthough many have been critical that Apple hasn't included a touchscreen the tech firm may have a point.\nMicrosoft unveiled its Surface Book laptop in the UK earlier this year which features a detachable touchscreen.\nIt's clever stuff, but having tested this ultimate portable Windows PC earlier this year, Express.co.uk soon became hugely frustrated with the experience.\nAlong with the bizarre gap that's created between the keyboard and the display.\nThere\u2019s also the matter of the annoying bounce whenever you use the Surface Book\u2019s touchscreen in laptop mode.\nWith a touch display you're also left with a screen covered in fingerprints.\nApple's products have always been about the user experience and producing the Touch Bar makes the new MacBook more interactive without compromising the design.\nTaking about this new technology, Schiller revealed: \"It\u2019s part of our thinking about where to take the notebook next.\n\"Others are trying to turn the notebook into the tablet. The new MacBook Pro is a product that celebrates that it is a notebook, this shape that has been with us for the last 25 years is probably going to be with us for another 25 years because there\u2019s something eternal about the basic notebook form factor.\n\"The team came up with this idea that you can create a multi-touch surface that\u2019s coplanar with the keyboard and the trackpad but brings a whole new experience into it, one that\u2019s more interactive, with multi-touch.\"\nExpress.co.uk has had an exclusive first-look at the new Touch Bar and our initial impressions are good.\nUsing it is incredibly intuitive and it makes tasks such as editing photos, replying to messages and even taking a screen shot a lot quicker, easier and far more fun.\nThe Bar also includes Touch ID which unlocks the MacBook with your fingerprint and allows you to securely pay for goods online.\nWe hope to bring you a full review of the MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar soon.\n", "tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "APPLE'S new MacBook Pro 2016 has finally been unveiled and senior VP Philip Schiller, reveals why it doesn't feature a touchscreen.", "site": "dailyexpress", "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/728790/New-Macbook-Pro-2016-Apple-Microsoft-laptop-touch-screen", "title": "New Macbook Pro 2016: Apple hasn't made the same mistake as Microsoft - here's why"}, "30": {"text": "Samsung is clearly feeling pretty confident about its latest smartwatch, the Gear S3.\nThe South Korean company has slapped a hefty \u00a3349 price tag on its latest wearable device, which we weren't too impressed with during our hands-on time back in September.\nMeanwhile, rival Apple \u2013 who at one time had the most expensive smartwatch on-sale \u2013 now sells a variation of the Apple Watch for \u00a3269.\nThe Apple Watch Series 1 starts from \u00a3269 for the 38mm case, and \u00a3299 42mm case.\nAlthough it sports the same dual-core processor as the Apple Watch Series 2, the entry-level wearable is not waterproof to 50metres, nor does it have an in-built GPS.\nSamsung finally started to take orders for its highly-anticipated Gear S3 smartwatch last week \u2013 some 60 days after the company first unveiled the gadget timepiece on-stage at the IFA consumer technology tradeshow in Berlin.\nFollowing on from the success of the Gear S2, the next-generation Samsung wearable comes in two new styles, dubbed Frontier and Classic.\nFrontier has been designed to act as both a fitness-minded watch, as well as a leisure wearable.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the Classic variation \u201cpays homage to the minimalist, elegant style found in the most iconic timepieces,\u201d according to Samsung.\nBoth variants of the tech timepiece keep the same spinning bezel mechanism that made the Gear S2 such a departure from other smartwatches.\n\"Whether you thirst for adventure, or prefer a more classic design, both are the perfect blend of form and function,\" the South Korean firm teases on its website.\u00a0\n\"Welcome to a new generation of smartwatches.\"\nBoth the Gear S3 Frontier and Gear S3 Classic for \u00a3349 through its online store.\nUnlike last year, the Gear S3 is now compatible with any standard 22mm watch band, so owners can quickly swap-out and customise their device, without being beholden to a single manufacturer, like some rival wearables.\nSamsung has also increased the size of the battery (upping the battery life to a staggering four days) and included a GPS to give the smartwatch more autonomy from your paired Android phone.\nUnfortunately these internal refinements come hand-in-hand with a number of unwelcome changes to the design \u2013 and size \u2013 of the Gear smartwatch range.\nThe Gear S3 Classic and Frontier are both incredibly large, bulky devices.\nSamsung has ditched the understated, compact design it employed with the Gear S2 in favour of a bigger battery, larger display and GPS chipset.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2013 we\u2019re not sure it is worth the trade-off.\nFor one thing, the latest iteration of the Samsung Gear smartwatch now appears to only target a male audience. The South Korean firm says that\u2019s by design, since its research shows 80 per cent of smartwatch owners are men.\u00a0\nBut that trend quickly becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when the only accomplished smartwatches on the market are swollen wrist-behemoths, like the Gear S3 Frontier.\u00a0\nAnd even amongst the target audience, the chunky Gear S3 series will only appeal to those looking for a large watch.\nUnlike rival smartwatch ranges from Apple and Motorola, there is no choice of screen size with the Gear S3 Classic and Frontier.\u00a0\nThat didn\u2019t matter so much with the slight,\u00a0one-size-fits-all Gear S2, but it feels like an issue that will alienate more than a few buyers this time around.\nThe S3 Classic is the least appealing of the two, thanks to its plain silver face, which lacks the design flourishes seen on the Gear S3 Frontier.\nSamsung's wearable operating system, TizenOS, still performs admirably, and the spinning bezel is a brilliant way to navigate around the beautiful, simplistic operating system.\nHowever the\u00a0app ecosystem hasn\u2019t grown in any meaningful way since it launched alongside the Samsung Gear S2, which is disappointing.\n\u00a0will be spending some more time with the Gear S3, and will have a full in-depth review soon.\n", "tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "SAMSUNG has unveiled the pricing for its Gear S3 smartwatch, and our least favourite variation is the most expensive \u2013 out-pricing some models of the Apple Watch.", "site": "dailyexpress", "url": "http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/728722/Samsung-Gear-S3-UK-Price-Stock-More-Than-Apple-Watch", "title": "Samsung Gear S3 - The worst version of this smartwatch costs more than an Apple Watch "}, "31": {"text": "The retailer said the UK closures come as part of an overhaul which will affect around 100 stores as it looks to cut back on clothing and home while boosting its Simply Food chain.\nDetails of the restructure came as it said underlying pre-tax profits fell 18.6 per cent to \u00a3231.3 million in the six months to October 1, while bottom-line profits crashed 88.4 per cent to \u00a325.1 million.\nChief executive Steve Rowe also outlined plans to shut 53 stores across 10 international markets - including 10 in China and seven in France, while pulling out of Belgium, Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania - putting around 2,100 jobs at risk.\nM&S said it will close around 30 of its 304 full-line stores - selling clothing and home as well as food - and downsize or replace around 45 shops to Simply Food outlets.\nIt will also relocate some other outlets, while opening other stores in so-called under-served areas.\nThe group remained tight-lipped on the number of UK staff impacted by the plans, but said that, where possible, it would keep \"job continuity\" for affected employees.\nThe group insisted it would have more stores overall after the revamp, with already-announced aims to open more than 200 Simply Food outlets by the end of the 2018/19 financial year.\nMr Rowe, who took over from Dutchman Marc Bolland in April, said: \"Over the next five years we will transform our UK estate with around 60 fewer clothing and home stores, whilst continuing to increase the number of our Simply Food stores.\n\"In the future, we will have more inspiring stores in places where customers want to shop.\"\nHe added: \"These are tough decisions, but vital to building a future M&S that is simpler, more relevant, multi-channel and focused on delivering sustainable returns.\"\nThe latest restructure moves come as M&S revealed more sales falls in its embattled clothing division, with like-for-like sales down by 5.9 per cent in the first half.\nBut it narrowed the sales decline from 8.9 per cent in the first quarter - its worst performance for a decade - to 2.9 per cent in the second quarter.\nSame-store food sales fell 0.9 per cent over the half-year, while it saw growth of 0.3 per cent at M&S.com, leaving overall UK like-for-like sales 3 per cent lower.\nMr Rowe said the group did not have a full list of outlets closing, adding that it would look at the overhaul on a \"store-by-store\" basis over the next five years.\nHe said M&S will have less space, but more stores as part of a \"rebalancing\".\n\"This is not about the M&S brand disappearing. We will be in more locations in the future,\" he added.\nThe group said the UK restructuring will cost it around \u00a3350 million over five years.\nM&S will also close loss-making owned businesses across 10 international markets at a cost of \u00a3150 million to \u00a3200 million over the next year.\nThe firm currently has 468 overseas stores across 58 international markets, with 194 owned stores and 274 franchise stores.\nMr Rowe - a company veteran with 26 years' service - is leading a shake-up to turn around its clothing arm and get group profits back on track.\nHe has already axed 525 jobs at the retailer's head office in a bid to cut costs in August.\nThe group said on announcing half-year results that its profit margins will take a hit from the sharp falls in the pound since the Brexit vote.\nBut it said it would continue to cut prices across its clothing lines and in its food arm as it looks to ramp up sales.\nM&S has seen its position shift from a retailer able to attract all age groups to a place seen by younger consumers as catering primarily for older generations - despite glamorous advertising campaigns and, most recently, two well-received collections from model Alexa Chung based on the store's fashion archive.\nCommentators say younger shoppers are being lured away by competitors which are cheaper, faster and more aspirational.\nMeanwhile the so-called fast fashion retailers like Primark and H&M have improved their quality and a new category of \"grown-up\" stores such as Reiss and Cos and have emerged.\nCustomers have also complained that they are confused amid racks of clothing divided into various brands but with little indication as to what separates one from another, and that items singled out by fashion experts - and there are many such pieces in every collection - are difficult to find within cluttered stores, if they have not already sold out.\nOther grumbles have also referred to too few shop assistants on hand to help navigate the racks and offer guidance on styling.\nEarlier this year, Mr Rowe announced that the \"neglected\" Mrs M&S was at the centre of plans to turn around his store's fortunes, saying he planned to \"celebrate and cherish\" the \"loyal\" army of women shoppers aged 50 and over - who have proved to be not quite so loyal after all.\nM&S knows its average customer is female, in her 50s, and shops with the group 18 times a year.\nTo cater more successfully to her, Mr Rowe talked about cutting back on fashion-focused clothing in favour of plans to \"re-establish our style authority\", with an emphasis on stylish wardrobe essentials to win back customers.\nHe also talked about providing pieces that can be worn with confidence as well as a focus on stylish everyday items and \"unrivalled quality\".\nHe pledged to reduce promotions and clearance sales and invest in lower everyday prices -

But nothing heats the insides quicker than a measure of akvavit (otherwise known as\u00a0aquavit).\nAkvavit is a misunderstood niche spirit and unless you know the Nordic drinking and dining scene, chances are you won\u2019t be familiar with it. Now is the time to try it, particularly since it sits nicely with the region\u2019s fashionable fare.\nAkvavit is a spirit distilled with botanicals, most notably caraway and dill. Other ingredients frequently employed include cardamom, cumin, anise, fennel and coriander with lemon or orange peel and even grains of paradise occasionally added. \u00a0\nThe base ingredient for most spirit produced in Sweden and Denmark is grain, but in Norway they tend to favour potatoes and rest the akvavit in casks. The variety of base ingredient alone presents versatility, throw in a range of botanicals and maturation and you start to see the potential, particularly when pairing with cuisine.\nThe dill and coriander are\u00a0obvious accents for simple starters. In crisp, unaged akvavit the drink can cut through the oil of salmon, or more fittingly a gravadlax starter and the botanicals can match the intensity of the ingredients on the plate. Danish producer Aalborg\u2019s is one of the most available brands in the UK, its Taffel variant driven by the caraway (\u00a321.95, Amathus) sweeter and just as useful with herring, or indeed roast pork and pickles.\nThey also have the Dild, as the name suggest with more dill (\u00a329.95, Amathus), which can also work with open sandwiches and, dare we say it, the faithful sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord. Both available at amathusdrinks.com, one of the leading retailers for akvavit.\nSk\u00e5ne (\u00a324.64, amathusdrinks.com) is Swedish and a touch smoother, the distillers suggest pairing it with fish soup or crayfish at midsummer parties, but the subtler expression of fennel also makes it useful with a fish main.\u00a0\nAmong the most interesting brands available in the UK is the Norwegian Linie (\u00a332, thewhiskyexchange.com). The company discovered the benefits of ageing by accident when stock sent to the Far East in the 19th century was returned unwanted. Recognising the improved flavour they set about recreating this akvavit and continue to rest the spirit in sherry casks.\nAmathus also stocks Linie Double Cask Madeira (\u00a335.26) and a Linie port wine and the spice, oak and robust warmth of these ensure they work beautifully with the cheese board. Sip all of them neat with Nordic cuisine but the mix of botanicals in akvavit make it an interesting cocktail: try dill akvavit replacing vodka in a twist on the Bloody Mary.\nThis version comes from the excellent Nick Kobbernagel-Hovind who created the drink in Ruby, a bar in Copenhagen and one of the best in the world.\nGlass: Collins\n60ml dill akvavit\u00a0 5ml ruby port 60ml tomato juice 17ml fresh lemon juice 6 dashes Worcestershire sauce 2 heavy dashes Tabasco 1 pinch celery salt 5 grinds of black pepper\n\u2009Pour all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and roll it gently for 6 seconds, then strain into the glass over ice.

As Chicago\u2019s mayor, Richard J. Daley, exclaimed:\u00a0\u201cMy God, they\u2019ve embalmed him before he even died.\u201d Kennedy, in contrast,\u00a0glowed with lusty good health - young, tanned and athletic - like the New\u00a0England princeling he was. I don't need to tell you who won.\u00a0\nClinton\u2019s self-presentation has been as vital a part of her campaign as any other\u00a0candidate\u2019s. More than this, she gets it. A quarter of a century of obsessive\u00a0scrutiny has made her an adept manipulator of this visual language.\u00a0Where once she resented the attention, now she exploits and satirises it. As\u00a0she noted, when her book, Hard Choices,\u00a0was released in spring 2014, her\u00a0favourite alternative title had been: The Scrunchie Chronicles, 112 Countries And\u00a0It\u2019s Still All About The Hair. At the same time, said hair has never looked better,\u00a0and never seemed more articulate of her coming of age as a candidate.\nIn the past, Clinton\u2019s style was subject to dramatic morphings. Back in the\u00a0Seventies, as Hillary Rodham, partner in one of the country\u2019s oldest law firms,\u00a0she favoured an unadorned look: glasses, straight brown hair, cosmetics-free.\u00a0However, as she and her husband endeavoured to conquer public life, slap and\u00a0peroxide became weapons in her arsenal.\nFor the 1992 election, the aspiring first lady countered her reputation for being a\u00a0feminist \u201cball-breaker\u201d with a femininely feathered fringe on a shoulder-length\u00a0coiffure, teamed with pearlised pink lips; becoming a chic crop and scarlet mouth\u00a0once her husband was in office. The Nineties saw her experiment with length,\u00a0wave, blue eye shadow, and her famous headbands (Clinton\u2019s pre-scrunchie\u00a0accessory of choice).\nThese vacillations suggested a woman uncomfortable with the decorative aspect\u00a0of the first lady role, a doer rather than a preener, who only started to find her\u00a0look when this look became about her. Once the focus shifted to her own political\u00a0career, the whole thing became more relaxed.\nAs New York Senator from 2001, and Secretary of State from 2009, Clinton\u2019s\u00a0wielding of hair and make-up became more about variations on a theme: short\u00a0crop, apricot blush, spot of interest about the lips \u2013 be they red, rosy, coral, or the\u00a0telegenic plum created for her by make-up artist Kriss Soterion for the\u00a0Democratic primary debates of 2008.\nIn 2012, as she approached becoming a private citizen for the first time in 30\u00a0years, the hair went long again, a presager of the strategically soft bob with\u00a0honeyed highlights that she has sported on the campaign trail. And - with the\u00a0exception of her dizzy and lipstickless appearance at the 9/11 memorial after\u00a0which her pneumonia was revealed - Clinton has never looked better: happy,\u00a0confident, and truly beautiful.\nFor the television debates, Clinton has accompanied her alternately red, blue and\u00a0white outfitting with a coral-red lipstick, peachy complexion, and black, but in no\u00a0way harsh, eye make-up. It is a simple, but efficient guise that says: \u201cWarm,\u00a0relaxed, and confident with this stuff\u201d.\nThere is a glow about Hillary, despite the arduousness of the campaign. Twitter\u00a0commentators have declared her debate demeanour Christ-like, and there is\u00a0something angelic about her beatific beam. This, not least, when compared with\u00a0a man whose satsuma complexion shade has been satirised as \u201cRage Red\u201d and\u00a0\u201cVeiled White Supremacy,\u201d\u00a0juxtaposed with luminous teeth, and lunatic hair.\u00a0\nAs Hitler recreated himself as a fascist Charlie Chaplin, so Trump has fashioned\u00a0himself as a capitalist clown: a decrepit parody of wealth\u2019s teeth and tan \u2013 the\u00a0bigger the lie, the bigger the hair.

Birthdays, graduation ceremonies and summer holidays, spanning more than 33 years of marriage, are all woven into this rich tapestry of memories. She looks at them and manages a smile.\n\u201cComing home is very hard. It is a beautiful house, but every corner of it is breathing Dave. It is hard to even walk in.\u201d\nArmstrong, 68, is dealing with an unimaginable tragedy. Three months ago, while the couple were at their holiday home in southern France, Wood disappeared without a trace.\nOn the morning of Aug 2, the 61-year-old telecoms engineer set off to walk part of the mountain route between the village of Marie in Alpes-Maritimes and Clans, a small town about 6km to the south \u2013 but never returned.\u00a0\nIt is a straightforward and scenic hike, past rocky outcrops, streams and forest, and one he enjoyed most days, walking as far as he could manage, before turning back. No one has ever gone missing in the area before and the fact that such an extensive search has unearthed not one shred of evidence as to his whereabouts is, say police, highly unusual.\n\u201cHe knew the area extremely well and knew the people,\u201d says Armstrong, an artist and painter. The couple had stayed in their house, just above Marie, for six weeks of every summer for the last six years. \u201cThe villagers absolutely took us in. Dave was well known. He is a big man with a mass of white hair. He is funny, very loving, warm and a fantastic father. People who know him really love him.\u201d\nSitting on the sofa of their home in Woodbridge, Suffolk, she cannot bring herself to use anything other than the present tense.\u00a0\nTo add to the confusion, Wood was in good health, apart from a recent diagnosis of elevated blood pressure \u2013 which prompted his decision to walk more and get fit \u2013 and a brief bout of labyrinthitis, an inner ear infection that can cause nausea, dizziness and problems with balance and hearing.\u00a0\nWood had been gone for about an hour when Armstrong first called his mobile to see where he was. Nothing seemed amiss; he said he was on his way back, about half an hour away. Half an hour passed and she rang again. He told her he was tired and had taken a rest. Again, he said he was about half an hour away.\n\u201cHe was supposed to be back by 2.30pm in the afternoon,\u201d recalls Armstrong. \u201cHe had a conference call booked. He had to be back. It is completely odd that he went so far.\u201d\nThat was the last time the couple spoke. After that, Wood\u2019s phone rang without answer.\nA large-scale search, headed up by Lieutenant-colonel Dominique Blasius, of the Alpes-Maritimes police department, lasted 10 days and included officers, abseil teams, hundreds of local volunteers, sniffer dogs and a helicopter. Wood had been carrying two phones \u2013 an iPhone and a French mobile. Police attempted to use his iPhone signal to geolocate him but, because he hadn\u2019t used it that day, an exact location hadn\u2019t been logged. The best police could do was narrow it to two remote areas the size of a kilometre each. Nothing was found.\nHis elder son Danny, 32, a product designer in Brighton, who immediately flew out with his brother to help with the search, put out a plea on Facebook for information.\n\u201cIf he fell on the path or just off the path, he would have been found,\u201d he wrote, in a post that has since been shared more than 2,000 times. \u201cThe forest nearby is very dense and, although he is an inquisitive person, he would not put himself in any unnecessary risk, so walking deep into it seems highly unlikely, especially as he knew that he had to be back home soon, these areas have also been heavily searched.\u201d\nIt was discovered that a couple on a motorbike had passed Wood on the path to Clans, when he stopped them to ask the direction of Marie. For some reason, he had been heading the opposite way. It is thought this was the last time he was seen.\u00a0\nAfter 10 days, the couple\u2019s younger son, Richard, 30, an engineer, had the bright idea to buy a drone to better scour ground that was less easily accessible by foot. After almost three weeks, however, the family returned to the UK, none the wiser.\u00a0\nToday, Armstrong has the look of a woman haunted by grief. Her eyes well with tears but she is determined not to be broken by the weight of either expectation or despair.\n\u201cIt is pulling us apart,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he is dead or alive. I think we all fear the worst but there is no proof. There is nothing. I keep asking, 'Dave, if you have died send me a message. Tell me something. I have got to know.\u2019 It is awful. It is eating us up. Danny, Richard and I are in a parallel universe. They are going to work, and that is helping them I think, but our heads are continually somewhere else. All the time I am thinking about him.\u201d\nThe couple met 40 years ago in Cambridge: Armstrong was working as an art therapist, Wood was doing a PhD. She calls it \u201cfriendship at first sight\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until they were both single, five years later, that he dropped everything and travelled to Spain to be with her. After that they \u201cshared everything\u201d. \u00a0\nTheories as to what happened to him abound. Did he fall and hurt himself? Did he have heatstroke and get lost? The possibility that Wood was involved in something dubious has inevitably crossed her mind.\u00a0\n\u201cBut none of those things makes sense. I heard all his conference calls. He was a very honest and honourable man. He wouldn\u2019t get himself into something strange. He just wouldn\u2019t. There was a time when we thought, was it foul play? Has someone hurt him by mistake?\u201d\nLieutenant-colonel Blasius is aware time is against them. \u201cHowever, we are not abandoning the search and I remain firmly convinced that David Wood suffered a cerebral malaise, became disoriented, and is still somewhere between the village of Clans and that of Marie,\u201d he says.\nHe has employed unorthodox methods of scanning the terrain, including a diviner and a spiritual medium.\u00a0\nOne hypothesis is that Wood\u2019s labyrinthitis had recurred, disorientating him and driving him deep into the mountains. In which case, he could be still be alive, lost in the denser forested areas.\n\u201cIf he is, I dread to think what kind of state he is in,\u201d says Armstrong.\nHospitals as far as Italy have been handed his description and now boar hunters are back out, combing the mountains, the hope is that his whereabouts will become known. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nFor now, Armstrong has no plans to return to France \u2013 \u201cthere is no point\u201d \u2013 and believes her energy is best directed into generating publicity around his disappearance.\nI remark on the incredible resilience and strength of resolve she has displayed throughout our conversation.\n\u201cI have got to,\u201d she replies. \u201cIf I collapse under all this, I might not be able to get back up. It is so terrible and there is no end in sight. It is not like the person you love most in the world has been killed by a car and then you grieve and go through all the process of grieving. I can\u2019t do that.

I was on a ferry, and on the car radio, an agony aunt was talking to a man who described himself as a six-foot rugby-playing policeman who, for 10 years, had been beaten almost daily by his five-foot-two wife. I vividly remember my \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d response. That actually happens to men?\nI sensed there was a story in this somewhere, and began to research. With surprising ease, I found people who knew a man it had happened to. In fact I had \u2013 and still have \u2013 the same conversation over and over again when I tell people that I have written about this topic. I could script it, and it goes exactly like this\u2026\nAn expert I spoke to in the late 90s\u00a0opined that the situation for male victims then was much the same as it had been for women thirty years earlier. Around the same time, a senior policeman told me that we shouldn\u2019t talk about male victims for fear that it takes the focus away from women.\nI continued to research, speaking to both male and female victims and found that just as the types of abuse reported by men are similar to the types of abuse reported by women, the impact of that abuse is much the same. What appears to be different is an unwillingness on the part of many men to accept that what has happened is actually abuse, many of them seeing it as something \u201cthat just happens\u201d.\nPart of male socialisation and the sexist stereotypes society imposes on our men and boys is to \u201cgrow a pair\u201d, \u201cman up\u201d, or \u201ctake it like a man\u201d. Therefore, it could be argued, men\u2019s weakness is their fa\u00e7ade of strength.\nAccording to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and the 2014/15 British Crime Survey, male victims (29pc) are more than twice as likely as women (12pc) to not tell anyone about the partner abuse they are experiencing, and only 10% of male victims will tell the police (26pc\u00a0women). These figures show that domestic abuse is, in general, underreported, and that surely calls into question the current trend towards a gendered approach.\nOver the years that I\u2019ve been observing this issue, the conversation has moved from being about domestic abuse to stopping violence against women and children. A laudable aim, for who in their right mind wouldn\u2019t want that to happen? My concern \u2013 and one that is shared by people who work with abused men \u2013 is that it appears that in this narrative male victims are being sidelined.\nIn 2015, 109,000 men reported to English and Welsh police forces that they were victims of domestic abuse, which constitutes 23pc of the overall total. This is not an insignificant number. Another study found that while men are eight times more likely to commit overall violence than women, there is gender parity in partner abuse. More worrying is the fact that more than 70pc of non-reciprocal violence is instigated by women. Things have changed, and not in a good way.\nGiven that the research indicates only 12% of male victims contact the police, it's probably\u00a0safe to assume the real figures are greater.\u00a0 Take those numbers and consider the help available for men. Twenty organisations offer refuge or safe house provision for male victims in the UK \u2013 a total of 82 spaces, of which 24 are dedicated to male DV victims only (the rest being for victims of either gender). For female victims, there close to 7,500 spaces for women and their children.\nSo where do we as a society go from here? We need an open and honest debate. We need to encourage all victims to come forward and seek help. We need to acknowledge that the barriers abused men face are not only attributable to a lack of visible and accessible support services, and the marginalisation of men in the public narrative of domestic abuse, but are also related to sexist stereotypes of what it means to be a \u201creal man\u201d.\nI believe we need to follow the lead of the female victims of domestic abuse who have come to me after reading my novel,\u00a0A Suitable Lie. They see this book as a commentary on domestic abuse and the horrors it inflicts. What they\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0see is gender. They see violence and its impact; they feel listened to; and they feel hope that together \u2013 women and men \u2013 we can rid our society of this scourge.\nPerhaps that generosity of spirit and empathy is where the experts need to go. Because, while they argue about who is doing what to whom and in what numbers,\u00a0people\u00a0are being hurt by other\u00a0people. And\u00a0people\u00a0and their children are not receiving the help and support they need.\nA Suitable Lie is published by Orenda Books, \u00a38.99\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "It was early 1998.", "site": "dailytelegraph", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/until-we-treat-male-and-female-domestic-abuse-victims-the-same-w/", "title": "Until we treat male and female domestic abuse victims the same, we'll never be rid of it"}, "45": {"text": "Today's IFS report\u00a0suggests that if the previous Chancellor's relentless focus on getting the public finances into surplus is abandoned, it will mean a deficit of at least \u00a315 billion in 2020. This is neither a One Nation approach, nor does it meet the Prime Minister\u2019s test of being \"for everyone\".\nSince June 23rd, our decision to leave the EU is being misinterpreted in all sorts of ways - from a justification for bizarre policies on reporting foreign workers, to a mandate to withdraw entirely from the European Single Market or from\u00a0free trade. Clearly voters in the referendum rejected \"business as usual\", but they did not reject the need for government to get to grips with the deficit. That was the central plank of the Conservative Manifesto which delivered a majority government just 18 months ago. The very first pledge in that manifesto was to \u201ckeep our economy secure by running a surplus so that we start paying down our debts\u201d.\nSpeaking to voters on both sides of the referendum debate, it is clear to me that the decision for many was less about the impact of Brexit on them, but more about their children and grandchildren. Voters rightly thought about the future and how Britain can be most successful in a globalised world, in a way that will deliver that most basic of human desires \u2013 for those who come after us to have greater opportunities than we did. Abandoning plans to deliver a budget surplus as the Chancellor has suggested does nothing to help achieve this.\nI have just turned 30, and it doesn't surprise me that the IFS found in recent research that my generation are half as wealthy as those born a decade earlier were at the same stage of life. People born in the 1980s are the first generation to earn less than those born in the previous decade; we\u2019ve been locked out of the property market which has delivered huge capital wealth to those before us; we face higher housing and rent costs; and we have far less generous pension schemes.\u00a0\nMore young people today believe they will start their own business than own their own home; while the start of that statement gives me great hope, the latter half is a disaster.\nMy generation, and to an even greater extent the one behind, face the triple-whammy of exorbitant student debt burdens, compulsory pension contributions, and higher taxes that deplete our incomes and ability to save. We live in a world of skewed transport costs, where it's cheaper for us to jet across Europe for a weekend in the sun than to travel home by train to see our parents. For the Chancellor to turn around post-EU referendum and land us with even greater debts to clear in the future, while continuing to protect pensioners with a triple-lock and universal benefits is simply unethical.\nAs the Chancellor himself said last at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham \u201cThe deficit remains unsustainable\u2026. And piling up debt for our children and our grandchildren to pay off is not only unsustainable... it\u2019s unfair\u2026 and it\u2019s downright un-Conservative.\u201d\nPublic Sector debt has trebled in ten years and now stands at 84 per cent of GDP, a figure set to grow by a further \u00a355bn this financial year. Eight years after the financial crash, in 2016 we will borrow \u00a31,700 for every person in the UK in work. It is worth remembering that the last time the public finances were in surplus was in 2001, in the last year of Ken Clarke\u2019s financial plans that were carried over into the early years of New Labour.\u00a0\nSo while we must invest in major infrastructure projects that secure our economic future, from HS2 to Crossrail 2, Heathrow (and for that matter Gatwick) expansion, renewal energy projects, upgrading roads across the regions, and build the new homes we desperately need, there is no reason to do this off the backs of the next generation. Borrowing to build new homes young people cannot afford, with debt we expect those same young people to pay back, is far from a sustainable future that works for everyone.\nPhilip Hammond must stick to his predecessor's plans for a surplus. With employment levels at a record high, more businesses operating in the UK than ever before, inflation low, and interest rates on the floor, he has a moral duty to act now to secure younger Britons' future. If he fails to act in a way that delivers generational equality, he'll not only be storing up crippling debts for millennials:\u00a0he'll be storing an electoral crisis for the Conservative Party.\nOwen Meredith is Deputy Chairman on the Tory Reform Group\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "Today's IFS report  suggests that if the previous Chancellor's relentless focus on getting the public finances into surplus is abandoned, it will mean a deficit of at least &pound;15 billion in 2020.", "site": "dailytelegraph", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/08/dont-let-up-on-cutting-the-deficit-chancellor-or-you-will-be-bet/", "title": "Don't let up on cutting the deficit, Chancellor, or you will betray millennials"}, "46": {"text": "Theresa May risked angering her hosts when she rejected calls from the government in Delhi to relax UK visa rules. But the Prime Minister, on a visit to India, was right to stand her ground. The biggest problem with illegal immigration in this country involves people overstaying after their visas have expired.\nMany are believed to be students who either come here with little intention of completing an academic course or simply stay on after finishing their degree. But tourists and people on work visas have been equally able to break the terms of their visas because the Home Office for many years had no way of knowing who had left the country.\nThe inability to count arrivals and departures has been a major hindrance to the UK\u2019s non-EU immigration policy since exit checks were abolished in 1998 on the grounds that they were ineffective. Ever since, ministers have pledged to restore some sort of comprehensive departure check; but it is only in the past year that data collected on travellers leaving at the borders have been routinely passed to the Home Office, ostensibly to help them track down overstayers.\nHowever, even when it is known that someone has not left the country, finding out where they are is not an easy business since they will often disappear into communities where they have family connections.\nThere are concerns that British inflexibility may harm efforts to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with India but there is no reason why these two matters should be connected.

By this stage I resembled nothing so much as a mortally wounded animal, howling to be put out of its misery. Yet,\u00a0the anaesthetist warned me that the\u00a0magic pain relief bullet he was about to fire up my spine might later cause me a headache.\n\u2018A headache?\u2019 I wanted to yell - but couldn\u2019t, because I\u2019d long since lost the power of speech.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m in so much pain my body\u2019s about to give out, and my mind gave up hours ago when I started moaning \u201cI \u2013 can\u2019t \u2013 cope\".\u2019\nA sore\u00a0head\u00a0is one of the few potential side effects of having an epidural anaesthesia, which numbs the pain nerves during labour. It can also, it is said, decelerate the birth itself - as the numbness it induces can make it harder to push the baby out.\nPerhaps. But my second baby popped out in three heaves -\u00a0despite me topping up my epidural medicine as often as the machinery would allow me. \u00a0\nSo why, then, do so many women feel ike availing themselves of this - or other effective pain relief medication during labour - is tantamount to surrender; even failure?\nA 2014 study of women\u2019s experiences of maternity care in England found that only 29 per cent\u00a0have an epidural for pain relief during labour. Why so few? We're encouraged to have our babies\u00a0as \u2018naturally\u2019 as possible. But, surely,\u00a0giving birth, by any means, is the most natural thing in the world and cannot be made \u2018unnatural\u2019 - no matter what interventions we might require to ease the process along?\nYet, a\u00a0harmful mythology surrounding the benefits of \u2018natural\u2019 birth persists. Goodness knows women aren\u2019t supposed to do anything else naturally, be it ageing,\u00a0growing body hair or even going make-up free. But when it comes to childbirth, we are encouraged to simply \u2018breathe through the pain.\u2019\n(Of course, before the advent of modern medicine, far more women died during labour, which was arguably also very natural. We draw the line at allowing this to happen now.)\nIn my pregnancy yoga class, the teacher read us grateful letters from former pupils who had supposedly used just their \u2018golden thread breaths\u2019 to get them over the threshold during childbirth. Hypnobirthing, meanwhile, blithely assures women that \u2018in the absence of fear and tension...severe pain does not have to be an accompaniment of labour.\u2019 \u00a0\nI hate to break it to any women planning to procreate, but in my limited experience, it does. \u00a0\nWe just don\u2019t talk about it very much. As with many other things that happen to women, it is not the done thing to go on about it. Those of us who have been through it perhaps don\u2019t want to put others off. (My own mother promised me childbirth was \u2018lovely\u2019. I duly screamed at her after my son was born: \u2018It wasn\u2019t!\u2019)\nBut there also exists a cultural conspiracy to hush things up;\u00a0to primly draw a curtain around the woman screaming on the labour ward and pretend her pain is less real if we just don\u2019t mention it.\nA Royal Society of Medicine meeting will be advised next month that women should feel no shame for requesting pain relief during labour and that medication like\u00a0epidurals have\u00a0no ill effect. It\u2019s a departure that can\u2019t come soon enough.\nDoctors will also say women have been misled into thinking a painful birth is better for them and the baby. Such demystification is long overdue and an important first step towards tackling the unjust stigma that still surrounds the woman who has \u2018given in\u2019 and asked for some proper pain relief.\nAfter giving birth to my daughter six months ago, the midwife told me: \u2018You didn\u2019t need that epidural. You\u2019d been doing really well.\u2019\nDear midwife, I did.

From Wolf Hall to The Lost Prince and Victoria, I\u2019m so glued to the box I can almost lick the screen. So imagine my pain when I realised I can\u2019t share in the orb-tactic experience that is The Crown: a ten-part series covering the modern royal family, which is expected to run to sixty episodes eventually and has already cost \u00a3100 million.\nWhy am I an exile from this small screen bliss? Because, unlike half the nation, I don\u2019t have Netflix. And it\u2019s my own puritanical fault. Something at the core of me objects to the subscription model, where TV programmes are streamed to the customer on demand. A schoolmarm side of me dislikes the idea of the impatient, voracious, sensation-bloated viewer being gratified whenever they like. Perhaps because I know that needy person could so easily (will?) be me.\nI still have a sentimental 20th-Century attachment to drama as Event TV; the notion that a vast proportion of the population will sit down and tune in to exactly the same gripping programme at precisely the moment as their neighbours, friends and family \u2013 that the next day your colleagues will talk through the screening with the certainty you watched it too. Later, in the pub, regulars will discuss an unseen plot twist over their pints and everyone will feel they have a small stake in family entertainment.\nExtraordinary to think it now, but on Christmas Day 1986 just over 30 million people tuned in to EastEnders to see Dirty Den hand over divorce papers to his wife Angie. In the US, the \u201cWho Shot JR?\u201d episode of Dallas attracted a mind-boggling 90 million viewers. Clearly, quite a few people cared more about these characters than they did about their own family. Woe betide the unworldly fool who phoned at a key moment: they would be excommunicated for life.\nMany of my classmates in the 1980s channelled their teenage passion and anxiety into TV soaps. One friend was so distraught when Bobby Ewing was shot that she kept bursting into tears for a fortnight. Another became so addicted to Neighbours that when she started medical training, she fell swiftly in love with an anaesthetist, who was the only other doctor at Guy\u2019s to sneak off at teatime for a dose of Scott and Charlene.\nI was more of a BBC drama junkie myself. My recent delight at The Night Manager zoomed me back to the first, great addictive Le Carr\u00e9 adaptation, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), starring Alec Guinness. When it was on, a spaceship full of aliens could have landed in the garden and my mum and I wouldn\u2019t have budged. We needed our fix.\nOf course, Saturday night light entertainment was the top communal experience for decades. It seems apt that Terry Johnson\u2019s play Dead Funny, which explores a fan club\u2019s obsession with comedians of the golden TV era, was revived this week at London\u2019s Vaudeville theatre. I watched it on Thursday and laughed like a drain, while wondering what anyone under 30 would make of it. How could today\u2019s young understand a world in which grown men\u2019s emotions were fixed in aspic in the 1970s, because they\u2019d watched too much Benny Hill and Sid James? But it makes perfect sense to anyone who gets misty-eyed at the mere mention of \u201cErnie\u2019s ghostly gold-tops a rattling in their crate.\u201d\nNetflix, Amazon and the iPlayer have changed the landscape of our televisual viewing. No longer will we idly watch something unfamiliar just because it\u2019s on the box and then find ourselves seduced by Etruscan history. Boredom first drove me to One Man and His Dog, but respect and Collie-love kept me watching. My knowledge of the classic cinema canon comes almost entirely from Sunday afternoon viewing, when the only alternative TV was sport.\nHow else would I have watched Ice Cold in Alex fifteen times? Or Went the Day Well, Random Harvest, Whisky Galore, or Black Narcissus? And I\u2019m grateful to all those times the afternoon\u2019s viewing was so deathly I had to read a book, or climb a tree instead. My children will never know the quiet despair of tuning on the box to find it\u2019s Crown Court and so opt for Jane Austen instead.\nToday\u2019s subscription audiences have their own narrow taste bounced back at them. The top sites have sophisticated algorithms to make sure you\u2019re fed more of what you think you crave; \u201cCritically \u2013 acclaimed Emotional Underdog Movies and \u201cVisually Striking Foreign Nostalgic Dramas\u201d are two real genres from over 75,000 on the Netflix database. An article in the Atlantic found that in 2014 the top two Netflix US viewing topics were \u201cAbout Marriage\u201d and \u201cAbout Royalty\u201d. The Crown is no accident of the dramatist\u2019s imagination. It\u2019s evolutionary science, or the TV equivalent of IVF: put the two strongest themes in a test-tube and hatch a sure-fire winner.\nAnd while that\u2019s well and good for undemanding, mainstream viewing, can you imagine anyone, ever, saying they\u2019d like a comedy about three celibate men cohabiting on a small island off the Irish coast?

But Bernard-Henri Levy, writing dispatches from the front line of the battle for Mosul, is not unusual. Kurdish Peshmerga units are full of embedded Western journalists and this isn\u2019t a coincidence. It\u2019s a canny move by the Kurdish Regional Government in Erbil to ensure the world knows about the Kurds\u2019 role in the offensive to retake Mosul, Iraq\u2019s third city, from Isil.\nYet while it makes for good reading, the bravery of the Kurdish Peshmerga (\u201cthose who stand in the face of death\u201d) forces is not actually the most notable aspect of the operation. More remarkable is the level of cooperation between the Kurds troops and the Iraqi national army.\nTwo years after Iraq\u2019s military turned tail and fled Mosul, leaving its residents to suffer under Isil\u2019s black flags, the same force is now leading the charge to retake the city. Better still, the operation has warmed relations between Baghdad and Kurdish leaders. The entente is fragile, but if it can hold, a stable Iraq might just emerge.\nThe operation has been set up carefully, with Western help. Iraqi troops have promised to stay in line and respect Kurdish territory. In turn, the Peshmerga have promised they won\u2019t enter Mosul. That part was easy, says Mike Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute, because the Kurds have no desire to repeat the mistakes made in 2003, when they conquered Mosul from Sunni Baathists, looted everything then tried to rule over a hostile population.\nThis time, the Kurds have their eyes on a bigger prize. In August, Erbil and Baghdad finally signed a deal to share revenues from oil production around Kirkuk, a city home to a large Kurdish population \u2013 and Iraq\u2019s richest oil reserves. Erbil badly needs the cash: since oil prices plunged, the Kurdish government has only been able to pay about half of the wages owed to its bloated civil service, according to Renad Mansour of Chatham House.\nIn Kirkuk, a special accommodation has been reached. Baghdad pays the salaries and the Peshmerga provide the security. Oil revenues are split fifty-fifty. That might not be a glorious step towards the independence the Kurds crave, but until an upturn in the oil price, that ambition is on the back burner. In addition to the oil deal, Baghdad has also been sharing Western-provided weaponry with the Peshmerga and including Kurdish officials in international summits.\nThe Mosul offensive is helping to strengthen this trust, but victory in the battle will bring two dangers. With Isil defeated, there will be a power vacuum in the city. Two other players will be trying to influence what happens next: Mosul\u2019s Sunni population and Iraq\u2019s Shia militias, who have mostly been kept out of the battle so far.\nMosul\u2019s Sunnis could make a strong case to be given more autonomy, along the lines of Kurdish Iraq. Iraq\u2019s constitution in theory grants them a large degree of self-governance, but it was never honoured by the previous regime in Baghdad. The city has been through hell under Isil and the coming battle could be even worse. It\u2019s also home to many former Baathists who supported Saddam Hussein. So even if they are granted more autonomy, it\u2019s not clear how its factions will agree to share power peacefully.\nAn even bigger challenge are the Shia militias. These bands are full of extremist, anti-Sunni soldiers and are backed by Iran, which is working to keep Iraq weak and unstable. If Iran gets its way and can boost the power of its cronies in Baghdad, led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, Iraq could fall back into chaos.\nAvoiding this fate will take patience, military strength and clever strategy. The West must keep together its coalition of European and US forces aiding Iraq\u2019s shaky government. But it must also help persuade Baghdad to accept reality and give the country\u2019s Sunnis more autonomy in a proper federal system. In order to hold Iraq together, its leaders must be prepared to split it up.\nThis will take years, not months, but it\u2019s a prize worth fighting for. If Iraq\u2019s sects and ethnic groups can find a way to share power, the country could become an example to the whole region. And as for Isil, which is about to lose the self-declared capital of its gruesome caliphate, it may simply collapse into the discarded wreckage of history where it belongs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "tags":

For that reason, we undertake an audit, to help understand what we most deeply appreciate and why.\nOne thing we can agree on. As wide as the choice of names is the menu of criteria. When Telegraph Sport reporters began nominating candidates, from W G Grace to the Brownlee brothers, it became obvious that the reasons for choosing this or that athlete were almost as numerous as the contenders themselves.\nOur cricket correspondent, Scyld Berry, for instance, argued for W G Grace on the basis that affecting society and changing the game itself is a vital measure.\nNaturally there was a tumble of other yardsticks, from pure talent, to longevity, to perseverance, to numerical benchmarks to charisma.\nThe ability to quell personal demons also popped up as an achievement worth recognising. All the while, the personal memories of each judge were calling up from their well to shape our choices.\nSuccess comes in British sport these days in a cascade; so much so that we have come to expect it.\nAndy Murray\u2019s first Wimbledon title felt like a catharsis that allowed Fred Perry to finally rest in peace. His second, this summer, was a triumphant affirmation of his talent and strength of character. It was, in that sense, unsurprising. A double Wimbledon men\u2019s champion? Consumption of a couple of jugs of Pimm\u2019s would have been required back in the 1980s or 90s even to imagine such a thing.\nWith Murray, you can throw in a US Open title and successive Olympic golds, as well as his colossal contribution to Britain\u2019s return from the wastelands of the Davis Cup. Through application and willpower, Murray escaped a place in history as the player who was good but not great, forever doomed to fall behind Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Murray\u2019s career is a study in refusing to accept easy money for finishing fourth.\nSee? Mention any big name and the brain starts charging down avenues of assessment, stopping to look at character as much as conquest.\nMost bizarre of all is that the picture just keeps improving. London 2012 was an epic mission accomplished, in medal terms, but then along came Rio 2016, where Britain became the first country to reach the podium more times than they had in a home Olympics four years previously.\nWhich is where we might bring in gender, and the probable imbalance in the final 100 between men and women: a disparity that reflects huge socio-economic factors but also the familiar category error of comparing women\u2019s sport to men\u2019s.\nMany of the derogatory comments about women\u2019s activities stem from the foolish premise that Rebecca Adlington would lose a swimming race with Adam Peaty, or that Virginia Wade would have been blown away by Murray.\nJess Ennis-Hill, Denise Lewis and Katherine Grainger compete against the best of their sex in their chosen sport, and the entertainment value from that is just as high. Of all the benefits of Britain\u2019s Olympic success, the advances made by women\u2019s sport is the most valuable.\nThe escalation of triumphs has left few sports behind, most notably football, where England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have between them reached one international final in 66 years of trying, though Wales\u2019 march to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 was a notable progression.\nFifty years on from Sir Bobby Charlton and Bobby Moore \u2013 1966 and all that \u2013 there is no subsequent English footballer demanding inclusion in the top 10 of a top 100. Across the other nations cases can be made for George Best, Ryan Giggs, Gareth Bale and Kenny Dalglish. There is no disguising the truth, however, that football is going to be poorly represented, given its hold on our everyday agenda.\nCharlton fills the roles of Munich air disaster survivor, World Cup and European Cup winner, and elder statesman of the English game. That CV takes some beating. It also introduces a note of conduct, or integrity, which takes us off the straight road of counting caps, titles and medals.\n'How we feel\u2019 about someone in sport shapes the list-making. In an age when looking up to superstar athletes is ever more complicated, those we consider to have affirmed our world view, or just made us feel better about life, are bound to shine more brightly.\nIf sport is essentially human struggle - against the opponent, nature, the clock, or against oneself \u2013 the eye will be pulled towards those who suffered for their art. In rugby union Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s self-pummelling perfectionism refused to give him a break even after he kicked the winning drop goal in the 2003 Rugby World Cup final in Sydney.\nFor many that moment of self-realisation would have blown away the pain forever. But it stalked Wilkinson for the rest of his career, and into retirement, where his confessions shed new light on the obsessive nature of successful sportsmen and women: the hidden price they pay.\nMartin Johnson, on the other hand, was Wilkinson\u2019s antithesis: a mighty leader who considered it his brief to conquer often and emote as little as possible. Away from England, others who consider rugby their favourite sport will prefer to reward the brilliant creativity of the Wales sides of the early 1970s. For a mass of observers, the pinnacle in sport is to be able to bamboozle: to deliver the shock of the unexpected. A case in point: the panache that elevated a Gareth Edwards or Phil Bennett above the bump and grind.\nBut still with struggle, sheer physical sacrifice, often called courage, takes sport into that wider realm where spectators identify games and pastimes as metaphors for life. So when Tony 'A P\u2019 McCoy wins 20 consecutive National Hunt jockey titles while smashing just about every bone in his body, endurance and indomitability become a daily spectacle we have only to travel to Fakenham or Taunton to examine. There are few areas of life where you can turn a Monday afternoon into a study of the human spirit (while also profiting from it, if you back a winner).\nBoxing is another sport that takes people to places most of us would have no wish to go, to face the fists and the brutal intent of another. On that path to the outer reaches, Joe Calzaghe and Lennox Lewis are among those who matched technical skill with bravery to leave an indelible mark in history.\nEqually the triathlete Brownlee brothers climbed higher ground when Alistair helped Jonny over the line this year in Mexico: an immortal study not only of Corinthianism but familial solidarity.\nThis search is not confined to the household names, the headline-hogging 'mainstream\u2019 sports. Nick Faldo and Ian Botham will have to fight it out with lower-profile champions. Again the sheer breadth of achievement is a major part of this story.\nWho would have thought that guilt trips could be such a part of this search. 'Who can we put in\u2019 has become 'Who had we better not leave out.\u2019 There are some truly great Olympians for example who are sometimes less swiftly acknowledged than the cyclists or stars of track and field. Ben Ainslie, a seaborne warrior, is one.\nSo the precise order of the top 100 is arguably less important than the process of working out how we measure success, which steers us from thought into the deeper mine of feeling. It might not be too grand to say it will tell us a lot about how we see life.\n\u00a0\n", "tags": ["sport"], "abstract": "The minefield of selecting the United Kingdom's all-time top 100 sportsmen and women is tiptoed across with good reason.", "site": "dailytelegraph", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2016/11/07/the-search-for-the-uks-greatest-ever-sportsperson-starts-now/", "title": "The search for the UK's greatest ever sportsperson starts now"}, "62": {"text": "More Of That could be a fascinating contender in Saturday\u2019s BetVictor Gold Cup following the glowing\u00a0 endorsements of Jonjo O\u2019Neill.\nThe participation of the 2014 World Hurdle winner is subject to rubber-stamping by his owner,\u00a0 J\u2009P McManus, and some rain, but trainer O\u2019Neill seemed to suggest Cheltenham would be on the cards after a recent reappearance at Carlisle was declined because of the ground.\n\u201cI\u2019m desperate to run him,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cOur horses are running a bit below par at the moment, but he seems in good form.\u201d More Of That was restricted to only three chase starts last term.

Who knows what the future may hold.\nIt actually feels odd for this Vend\u00e9e Globe not to feature any women because in many ways female sailing is riding the crest of a wave at the moment.

The last time the moon was this close to the Earth was in 1948.\nThe reason the distance varies is the moon's slightly elliptical orbit. On average, it is 238,900 miles from the Earth, but at the perigee it is about five per cent closer. At its furthest orbital point from the Earth, the apogee, it is five per cent more distant.\nPerigee and apogee distances vary from month to month due to several factors, such as whether the long axis of the lunar orbit is pointed towards the sun.\nMonday's event was billed as the biggest and best in a series of three supermoons. \u00a0The first was on October 16 and the third is due on December 14.\nAfter that, the event will not be matched until the moon makes a similar approach in 2034.\nYou can view other supermoon pictures in our gallery here.\nEver looked\u00a0up at the night sky to see a full\u00a0moon so close you could almost touch it? Well done, you've spotted a\u00a0supermoon.\u00a0\nThe impressive sight\u00a0happens\u00a0when a full moon\u00a0is closest to Earth. It orbits our planet in an oval shape so sometimes it comes closer to us than at other times.\u00a0To us Earth-lings,\u00a0the moon appears\u00a030 per cent brighter and 14 per cent bigger.\u00a0\nBy the way, supermoon is not an astrological term. It's scientific\u00a0name is perigee-syzygy, but supermoon is more catchy, and is used by the media to describe our celestial neighbour when it gets up close.\nAstrologer\u00a0Richard Nolle first\u00a0came up with the term and he defined it as \"\u2026 a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near (within 90 per cent\u00a0of) its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit\", according to earthsky.org.\nRobin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: \"It will be above rooftops and trees and chimneys and always appears bigger that way because you're comparing it to foreground objects.\n\"I'm always pleased\u00a0for people to get their binoculars out and look up at the craters and the seas.\"\nAs well as being closer and brighter, the moon will look orange and red when it first rises.\u00a0As the moon gets higher in the sky, it returns to its normal white/yellow\u00a0colour.\u00a0\nThey're fairly frequent, although November's supermoon will be a once-in-a-generation sight.\u00a0There\u00a0are\u00a0six supermoons in 2016. We've already had four, and after next week\u00a0there's one on December 14. \u00a0\nEach\u00a0full moon of the year is given a name - although they vary according to the source. October's full moon is\u00a0referred to as the Hunter's moon because it\u00a0appears\u00a0very soon after sunset, and traditionally generated\u00a0more light for farmers working in the fields and hunters to spot wildlife.\u00a0\nIt might look close, but of course it's not that close.\u00a0November 14's\u00a0full moon will be the closest for 70 years.\u00a0The moon will come 221,524 miles from Earth -\u00a0almost touching distance in space terms.\u00a0\nThe closest full moon of the whole of the\u00a021st century will fall on December 6, 2052.\nPossibly, yes. Most people know that tides are governed by the gravitational pull of the moon and, to a lesser extent, the sun. Because the sun and moon go through different alignments, this affects the size of the tides.\nWhen the moon is closer to Earth, it\u00a0can lead to slightly higher tides, and greater variations between the tides.\nFull moon:\u00a0We all know what these are. They come around every month and light up the night at night.\nHarvest moon: The\u00a0full moon closest to the autumn equinox.\nBlack moon:\u00a0Most experts agree that this\u00a0refers to the second new moon in a calendar month.\u00a0The last black moon was at the start of October 2016 and the\u00a0next one\u00a0is expected in 2019.\nBlue moon:\u00a0A phenomenon that occurs when there is a second full moon in one calendar month.\u00a0Joe Rao\u00a0from space.com\u00a0explains: \"A second full moon in a single calendar month is sometimes called a blue moon. A black moon is supposedly the flip side of a blue moon; the second new moon in a single calendar month.\"\nThe infrequent nature of this lunar event led to the phrase \"once in a blue moon\" to signify a rare occurrence. It does not actually mean the moon will be blue.\nBlood moon: Also known as a\u00a0supermoon lunar eclipse. It's\u00a0when\u00a0the shadow of Earth casts a reddish glow on the moon, the result of a\u00a0rare combination of an eclipse with the closest full moon of the year. \u00a0There was one in September 2015, and before that in 1982\u00a0but the next one won't be until 2033.\u00a0\nStrawberry moon: A rare event when there's a full moon on the same day as the summer solstice. It happened in June 2016 for the first time since 1967 when\u00a017 hours of sunlight gave way to a bright moonlit sky.\nDespite the name, the moon does appear pink or red. The romantic label was coined by the Algonquin tribes of North America who believed June\u2019s full moon signalled the beginning of the strawberry picking season.\nAside from mythical meanings and unfounded alarmist proclamations, any full moon - never mind a supermoon as big as this \u00a0- has long been seen as having the ability to trigger emotional reactions and extreme behaviour.\nAnd while it may be easy to scoff, these theories have been given added credence in recent years by claims that there is a spike in admissions to hospitals when the moon is full, and by police forces reporting a rise in crime.\nJust last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that nearly all the staff in a hospital in Connecticut were convinced that a full moon ensured they had a busy night ahead of them.\nMeanwhile, a study published in the World Journal of Surgery in 2011 found that more than 40 per cent of medical staff believed lunar phases had an impact on human behaviour and, in 2007, Sussex Police announced that they would put extra officers on patrol on nights when the moon was full, following research that showed \u201ca correlation between violent incidents and full moons\u201d.\nOne theory is that the water in our bodies is affected by the movement of the moon in much the same way as its gravitational pull controls the tides. As the fluid in our body shifts, it tips the balance in our minds, which can trigger extreme emotions.\nThe \u201clunar effect\u201d, though, has been rubbished by a series of studies which have found no statistical correlation between lunar phases and events such as births, deaths, suicides, violence and psychiatric hospital admissions. However, says Dr Niall McCrae, a lecturer in mental health at King\u2019s College London and the author of 'The Moon and Madness\u2019, we should not dismiss the moon\u2019s effect so swiftly.\nAlthough he agrees the idea that our internal waters have some sort of tidal motion is \u201cunfounded\u201d, Dr McCrae points to studies that have shown the impact of moonlight on sleep as a feasible demonstration of the moon\u2019s effect on the brain. Swiss researchers found in 2013 that, on average, people slept for 20 minutes less when there was a full moon. It may not sound like much, but such differences might well be the reason for the centuries-old association of lunacy with lunar cycles.\nThe moon\u00a0is the Earth's only natural satellite. It's 4.6 billion years old and was formed between 30-50 million years after the solar system was formed.\u00a0\nThe moon is smaller than Earth.\u00a0It's about the same size as Pluto. In fact its\u00a0surface area is actually less than the surface\u00a0area of Asia - about 14.6 million square miles, according to space.com.\nA\u00a0new moon occurs every 29.5 days. The moon 'disappears' from the sky when it is between Earth and the sun\u00a0with it\u2019s illuminated side facing away from us.\nWhen the moon is opposite the sun we see a full moon as it's fully lit up by the sun. In between, we see a crescent moon as only some reflected sunlight is seen.\u00a0\nThe moon has earthquakes, caused by the gravitational pull of Earth. Experts believe the moon has a molten core, just like Earth.\u00a0\nOnly 12 people have ever walked on the moon and they were all American men, including (most famously) Neil Armstrong who was the first in 1969 on the Apollo II mission.\u00a0\nThe last time mankind sent someone to the moon was in 1972 when\u00a0Gene Cernan visited on the Apollo 17 mission.\nAlthough\u00a0Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon,\u00a0Buzz Aldrin was the first man to urinate there. While millions watched the moon landing on live television, Aldrin was forced to go in a\u00a0tube fitted inside his space suit.\nWhen the\u00a0astronauts took off their helmets after their moonwalk, they noticed a strong smell, which Armstrong described as \u201cwet ashes in a fireplace\u201d and Aldrin as \u201cspent gunpowder\u201d. It was the smell of moon-dust brought in on their boots.\nThe mineral, armalcolite, discovered during the first moon landing and later found at various locations on Earth, was named after the three Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil ARMstrong, Buzz ALdrin and Michael COLlins.\nAn estimated 600 million people watched the Apollo 11 landing live on television, a world record until 750 million people watched the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981.\nOne of President Nixon\u2019s speechwriters had prepared an address entitled: \u201cIn Event of Moon Disaster\u201d. It began: \u201cFate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay to rest in peace.\u201d If the launch from the Moon had failed, Houston was to close down communications and leave Armstrong and Aldrin to their death.\n\u00a0\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Cloudy conditions hampered the efforts of many UK sky-gazers to see the supermoon as the natural satellite came closer to Earth than it has in decades.", "site": "dailytelegraph", "url": null, "title": "What is a supermoon and when can I see the next one after clouds hampered view for many sky-gazers?"}, "71": {"text": "Primark could benefit from a UK outside of the EU if the\u00a0Government were\u00a0able to negotiate tariff-free trade deals with countries such as Sri Lanka, which is a big manufacturer of clothing, its boss has said.\nGeorge Weston, chief executive of Associated British Foods, the FTSE\u00a0100 food and retail giant that owns Primark, said the referendum result had thrown up a number of mixed opportunities and threats.\nFor Primark, he said it would be beneficial if\u00a0certain tariffs imposed on clothes imported from Sri Lanka -\u00a0on which the EU currently levies an 11pc import charge -\u00a0were axed.\u00a0In other places, such as Bangladesh, he said retaining tariff-free imports would be welcome.\n\u201cThe EU has chosen to support manufacturing industries in some countries but not others,\u201d he said.\nThe devaluation of sterling will hit\u00a0Primark\u2019s UK sales next year because it sources its goods in dollars.

Luxury fashion houses have long borrowed elements of both ceremonial swagger and utilitarianism from the style sheet of military uniform. \nIn the 1960s, Yves Saint Laurent designed his famous pea coats, igniting a trend for exquisite military-inspired clothing and coats soon followed by designers including Dries Van Noten, Balmain and Givenchy, among many others. \nAccessories have also benefited from similar inspiration, evidenced by Tom Ford's aviator sunglasses and Louis Vuitton handbags and luggage. At the other end of the fashion scale, in the 1960s, hippies wore cargo pants and army jackets as political statements. \nNow camouflage prints are visible on anything from Nike athletic shoes to bandages and sticking plasters for children. The military influence even goes beyond clothes to interior design, seen in campaign chairs with leather straps and austere lines, to portable Hermes desks.\nThe genius of military design \nI remember my father's wardrobe in the spare room at home, where his army uniform hung neatly next to his crested blazer from Trinity College, Melbourne. This wardrobe was a constant fascination to me growing up for the way in which its contents represented power, intellect and sophistication. \nI noticed the nuances of clothing and how what we wear affects how we feel and behave. I also noticed how costumes functioned in movies -- how often, for example, the villains' frightening outfits were derived from extreme military looks, such as those of the SS or the Gestapo. \nI saw how rock musicians, from the Beatles to Duran Duran and beyond, referenced military clothing in their stage costumes and on their album covers.\nI once came across a photograph of Lord Albert Victor in full military regalia. The striking blue and the encrusted gold and silver used in the trimmings and sashes were strong and imperial. They were powerful evidence of the genius that underlay military design. Then I caught sight of myself in a mirror. \nFollowing men's fashion that year, I was dressed in fatigue cargo pants tucked into leather boots and a loden green sweater. My hair was slicked back as severely as if I had just stepped out of a plane after flying a bombing mission in World War II. \nI laughed at myself, of course, but the echoes between the photograph and my own clothes made me determined to explore further.

Visits are only granted through specific tour groups, itineraries are heavily planned by tour guides, and certain areas are strictly off limits, so everyday life in North Korea is often hidden from outsiders. \nBut when 25-year-old photographer Elaine Li made her first trip to the North Korea's capital in October, what struck her most was the sense of familiarity. \nBorn and raised in Hong Kong, Li is no stranger to city life. Her portfolio -- largely filled with images of skyscrapers, traffic jams and amusing commutes -- has built the young photographer a following of over 133,000 on Instagram. \nWhile schools, restaurants and city landmarks were all on her itinerary, it was a ride in the subway that felt closest to home. She spoke to CNN Style about the experience. \nCNN: What were your first impressions of the Pyongyang Metro? \nElaine Li: The first thing I noticed was that, although the stations are very dimly lit, the interiors are very fancy. You see chandeliers on the ceilings, marble pillars and paintings of Kim Jong Il. \nThe next thing I noticed was the newspaper stands that are on display across the platform itself -- you'll see people standing around and reading them. \nThis was all very interesting to me because, in cosmopolitan cities like Hong Kong, we are bombarded with advertising. In Pyongyang, they are bombarded with propaganda. \nWere you given any restrictions when photographing the subway?\nIn general I had no issues getting permission to take photographs on the trains or stations.\n The tour guides accompanied us for the whole commute, but on the platform we were free to roam around. \nAs for traveling on the train itself, we were only allowed to travel for a few stops, and only got off at certain stations. \nThe only restriction was that we were not allowed to take photographs from inside the tunnels, I am not sure why.\nWhat was it like on the trains? \nThe first thing I noticed was how quiet it was. It seemed so tame -- no one was saying anything -- and perhaps could even be described as a little lifeless. \nBut then I came back to the subway in Hong Kong and I realized ... people here lack communication as well. \nEven though the Hong Kong trains are louder and it seems more lively at first, the reality is that commuters here do not communicate. They are glued to their smartphones. In Pyongyang I did see some people on their smartphones, but far fewer.\nInstead they were looking around, seemed almost shy, but not really talking to each other either. I realized that, in a way, this commute was just like commutes in so many other Asian cities. \nDid you interact with any commuters? \nAt one point I almost missed my train because I was taking a picture of a female conductor while the rest of my tour group was on the train -- and the door slammed shut. \nThe conductor I was photographing then whistled to the train driver, indicating that he should open the door and let me on. \nAnother interaction was with an elderly man. I wanted to give him my seat so patted him on the shoulder, but at first he didn't understand. So another lady communicated to him that I wanted to give him my seat. \nThese interactions were definitely the most interesting parts of my journey. They were so small but felt so human. It reminded me that wherever we are, we all have these common human interests, such as taking care of our elderly. \nWhat has the response been to your photography? \nIt's been very heavily mixed. Some people say these images are eye opening, and show a side to the country that they don't usually get to see. Others ask why I would ever go to North Korea in the first place, then claim my images are propaganda and that I'm sponsored by North Korea. \nThe preconceptions that people have were really reflected on the comments I've received.

By way of comparison, major indexes fell about 2% four years ago after President Obama was re-elected. \n Global markets are also, for the most part, acting calmly. Japan's Nikkei, one of the first to open as the election results rolled in, did plunge 5%.

That is a big concern and it could slow economic growth around the globe,\" he said. \n Canally noted that there could be plenty of potential economic positives from a Trump presidency, such as less regulation, tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending. \n And the worst-case scenario for investors has been avoided. This election is truly over. We don't have a repeat of 2000. \n \"The result is known, and that is great,\" Canally said. \n David Jilek, chief investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers, added that Trump's positive tone during his acceptance speech also may have helped to reassure investors. \n \"We have a robust enough economic system that any continued uncertainty surrounding this election can be tolerated.

Other states that have approved non-medical marijuana offer some clues. \n Colorado is probably the best example. Voters approved recreational weed there in 2012, the earliest of any state that still has it. And, like California, it already had legal medical marijuana, so there was already a network of medical dispensaries and growers. \n Legal recreational weed went on sale in Colorado in 2014, and state economists had great expectations. Analysts projected that the first full fiscal year, through June 2015, would bring in $70 million in tax revenue. \n \"It was a brand new industry with new challenges, so any estimate was going to be educated guesswork,\" said Joe Henchman, vice president of state and legal affairs for the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group. \n But just a few months after legal sales began, tax flow was disappointing, and economists decided they had been too optimistic. So they lowered that estimate to $54.7 million. \n They should have waited. Sales picked up. Colorado wound up with $106 million in tax revenue from recreational weed from the first full fiscal year that it was legal. \n As it turns out, the market was just getting started. The next year, the state pulled in $163 million. \n \"It took a little bit longer for the market to fully establish itself than originally projected,\" said Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association. \n Colorado is off to an even stronger start in its current fiscal year, which began July 1. The state reported $17.6 million for July and $19 million for August, its two strongest months so far. \n Colorado charges a 10% sales tax on pot on top of its regular sales tax. Sellers cover a 15% excise tax, plus application and license fees. \n In California, $1 billion a year is the high end of the estimate from the state Legislative Analyst's Office. The low end is the high hundreds of millions. \n That forecast is written right into Proposition 64, the ballot item that voters will consider. It's based on cultivation taxes of $9.25 per ounce of buds and $2.75 per ounce of leaves, plus a 15% excise tax. \n A billion dollars may seem small compared with California's overall budget of $170 billion. But the revenue is earmarked for a slew of projects, including substance abuse prevention and treatment, cleanup of environmental damage from illegal pot growth, and programs to reduce drunken and stoned driving. \n \"I'm not trying to scoff at a billion dollars,\" said Adam Orens, co-founder of the Marijuana Policy Group. \"A lot can be done with it. Voters should take that into consideration.\" \n \n Recreational marijuana is also on the ballot in Massachusetts, Maine, Arizona and Nevada. \n It is already legal in Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. Two of those states, Washington and Oregon, have been selling legal weed long enough to provide reliable data. \n Washington collected $77 million in taxes during its first full fiscal year of recreational legalization, which ended on June 30, according to the Tax Foundation. The current year is projected to bring in at least $270 million in taxes. \n Voters were told that legalization would bring in as much as $1.9 billion over five years, said the Tax Foundation, with 40% going to the general fund and the rest going to substance abuse prevention, research education and health care. It remains to be seen whether tax revenue will match that forecast. \n Oregon started selling recreational marijuana in late 2015. In the most recent month available, January 2016, it collected about $3.5 million in tax revenue -- triple the expectation, according to the Tax Foundation. \n Four states -- Florida, Missouri, Arkansas and North Dakota -- are voting on whether to legalize medical marijuana, which is taxed, but not nearly so much as recreational pot.

Nobody knows. Some of the more popular theories include madness, drinking problems, a gory fight with artist friend Paul Gauguin and a desire to be coddled by his mother. \nMore than a hundred years later, it is still the most debated event in the famed Dutch artist's life.\nBut a new book suggests another likely motive: He heard wedding bells.\nVan Gogh suffered a breakdown and cut off his ear after receiving a letter informing him that his brother Theo was getting married, says art expert Martin Bailey in his book,\"Studio of the South: Van Gogh in Provence.\"\n\"It was fear that pulled the trigger and led to the breakdown,\" Bailey told CNN in an interview. \"Fear of being abandoned in both an emotional and financial way.\"\nPutting the clues together\nSome historians have dismissed this theory, as they assume Van Gogh learned of his brother's engagement long after the ear episode. But Bailey disagrees.\n\"There are other more ridiculous theories out there. I look at the facts and the news of the wedding almost certainly reached him that day,\" he said. \n\"It's a matter of putting all the clues together. We don't have that letter, but in another one Van Gogh sends in January, he mentions receiving money from his brother on the 23rd of December.\"\nBailey believes the money had to come with the news that Theo and art dealer Jo Bonger were engaged.\n\"What has escaped the attention of Van Gogh scholars is that the fianc\u00e9e received a telegram of congratulations on 23 December from her older brother Henry,\" said Bailey. He added that Theo had written to his own mother two days earlier, and would want to share the news with his older brother to avoid him getting the information from others. \nVan Gogh and his brother were close, and the struggling artist relied on Theo for financial support. Van Gogh was likely despairing that Theo's marriage would harm their close relationship and that the pressures of supporting a growing family would leave Theo less money to give to his brother, Bailey said.\n\"At a deeper level, there may possibly have been an element of jealousy; Theo had succeeded in finding love, whereas Vincent had failed to sustain long-term relationships,\" wrote Bailey in the book.\nThe Van Gogh story everyone wants to hear\nBailey's book focuses on Van Gogh's stay in Arles, in the south of France, where he lived in a self-described \"Yellow House\" and became enchanted by bright colors.\n\"The sunny environment of the south opened his eyes to a new way to use light and colors. He had never been so dramatic and bold. It was a period of great creativity, and the first time he had his own home,\" Bailey said.\nBut it is the \"ear chapter,\" as some call it, that grabs casual readers' attention.\n\"It's the Van Gogh story everyone wants to know about. Writing about that period, I had to include it,\" Bailey told CNN. \"There was an enormous public interest, both now and back at the time, when newspapers wrote about the event.\" \nAfter cutting off his ear Van Gogh put on his beret and dragged himself to a nearby brothel to give the severed earlobe, wrapped in paper, to a young woman recently identified as Gabrielle Berlatier.\nAfter Berlatier fainted on the spot at the sight of the ear, Van Gogh fled -- and the ensuing chaos caused a stir in the local press.\nBailey writes that Van Gogh would describe the events as \"a simple artist's bout of craziness and then a lot of fever following a very considerable loss of blood, as an artery was severed.\" \nBut while the wound healed, the mutilated ear was a terrible disfigurement and became a constant reminder of what the painter had done. \n'Wedding was only the trigger'\nWhile news of the wedding was what pushed Van Gogh over the edge, Bailey told CNN it was not the sole catalyst.\n\"There is still a lot of debate around Van Gogh's medical problems, and there are thousands of papers in medical journals debating them. The wedding was only the trigger,\" the author said. \nWhile his own doctors believed the artist suffered from epilepsy, recent experts have suggested absinthe poisoning, alcoholism, bipolar disorder, and sunstroke among other factors. There is no consensus. \nSelf-mutilation might have well been the artist's plea for help. \nAn 1893 letter discussing Van Gogh's medical records states the Dutch impressionist was \"prey to aural hallucinations,\" Bailey said.

How do you give something a form that means this?\" \nIn spirit and in structure, the building was to embody the unity of mankind, which is a central belief of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, an independent religion founded in 19th century Iran. \nThe Chile Temple is the final Bah\u00e1'\u00ed continental temple to be built, joining eight others, including the Temple for North America in Wilmette, Illinois, and the Lotus Temple in New Delhi, India.\nA Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Temple has only a few criteria: it needs to be \"a nine-sided domed structure with nine entrances to symbolically welcome people from all directions of the earth for prayer and meditation.\" \nFaced with this architectural challenge, Hariri and his creative team did not want to take inspiration from other buildings. It could not look like a mosque, a synagogue or a church as this may alienate certain people. \nEqually, drawing on the culture of one or some of the indigenous communities of Chile was not a priority, as it would involve excluding others. \"They're not all the same, you can't just lump everything together,\" Hariri told CNN, \"if I went Quechua, the Mapuche would not be represented, and so on. It is very delicate.\"\nIn search of a \"feeling\" \nRather, they were in search of a \"feeling\" and aesthetic cues were taken from taken from outside of architecture.\n\"We looked to organic forms: a cheekbone is a universal thing, right?\" asked Hariri rhetorically, later mentioning the veins of a leaf, the curve of a woven Japanese basket, and the folding of robes in paintings of the old masters. \nOn some days, the Temple looks like it has always existed as part of its organically formed backdrop, the Andes. The radial gardens, designed by acclaimed Chilean landscape architect Juan Grimm, are made to blend into the Andean environment, creating a \"garden that has no limits.\" \nAbove all, light is the defining trope of the structure: Hariri feels that \"light is universal\" and can act as a symbol of unity. The temple was designed to cause visitors to feel like they were gazing up at the heavens or turning towards the light, like a plant moves to face the sun. \nNine wing-like panels of translucent cast glass subtly spiral to form the temple dome, converging 90 feet above the ground with a clear glass oculus holding a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed symbol known as \"the greatest name.\" Daylight passes through the glass and floods the white marble interior and after sundown, light from within causes the structure to quietly glow in the night.\n\"The temple is like a drapery of light,\" says Hariri, \"It's not light passing through -- it's captured light.\"\nEarthquake resistant \nIn pursuit of this \"feeling\", the multidisciplinary team adopted three-dimensional modeling software CATIA, made for industrial design and aerospace engineering and rarely used in architecture, which was a daring move and \"breathtakingly hard\" 13 years ago at the beginning of the project.\nAnother technical feat was the installation of a pendulum isolation system to make the building resistant to seismic activity. Three universities -- in Canada, Los Angeles and Chile -- collaborated to create a system that allows for 600 millimeters of movement, so that the whole building rocks and returns to the center in case of an earthquake. \nCoexisting with innovations in technology and machine-to-machine production is an artisanal quality, created by the use of ancient materials like bronze, cast glass, and stone. \nThe bronze doorways are molded by hand, and the cast glass on the exterior of the Temple was invented using melted down test tubes and petri dishes in the studio kilns of Jeff Goodman, a Canadian glass artist known for his ornate blown-glass creations.\nOver 30,000 square meters of glass were fired in a bespoke factory of six kilns to produce around 1,100 glass panels of various shapes and sizes, which slot into place to form the exterior of the \"wings,\" supported by steel frames coursing through the edifice like the veins of a leaf.  \n\"It is a very deliberate intersection between the ancient and the absolute new. That's not just architectural, it's philosophical,\" mused Hariri, intimating the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed belief that all the religions of the past and future are one, \"this extension both forward and back is very symbolic.\"\nFaith in the theories\nLooking at the finished structure, Hariri is happy and perhaps relieved: there was no guarantee that the computer modeling would translate into the desired effect of \"embodied light,\" captured in the glass. \n\"That was one of our biggest worries, would that in fact happen -- it's a theory!\" he breathed, \"You hope it does, that [the light] does kiss that marble.\" \nThe Temple is built to last 400 years: time will tell if the theory of a universally attractive form holds, too.

In June, a rape victim at Stanford University wrote a letter to Brock Turner, the man who assaulted her behind a dumpster, that was read by millions, including on-air by CNN anchor Ashleigh Banfield. Earlier this month, Harvard University canceled the men's soccer season after another op-ed written by female victims, this time soccer players whose male teammates assigned them sexual ratings and ideal intercourse \"positions.\" \nThe press attention devoted to sexual assault, particularly when magnified by election coverage, provokes uncomfortable, disturbing emotions. But the media coverage is good news for women, because of one fact: We're talking about it.\nThese experiences are all too familiar, for myself and millions of others. From the time I was 11 years old, I've survived unwanted kisses and exposure to strange men's genitals, slut-shaming, relationship violence and sexual harassment. It's time that victims and the media speak out about these issues, especially when it comes to institutions of higher learning, our most hopeful melting pots.\nAnd yet, on the same day that Harvard took action against its men's soccer team, Rolling Stone magazine and writer Sabrina Erdely were found guilty of defamation in the infamous 2014 article, \"A Rape on Campus.\" University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo's triumph against Rolling Stone and Erdely -- the jury awarded Eramo $3 million -- is a pyrrhic victory. Although the story's lead anecdote was quickly debunked, it remains true that sexual assault is a problem on college campuses. \nAs the documentary \"The Hunting Ground\" revealed, universities have long betrayed students by questioning victims' integrity, by framing assault as an unprovable, unprosecutable offense and by levying shallow penalties such as \"suspension after graduation.\" Imagine if UVA and other elite universities fought as valiantly to protect their students as they did their brand.\nAnd what about Harvard, my alma mater? When I was a freshman in 1983, Harvard police proudly demonstrated the emergency blue-light campus phones and warned us about strange men in Harvard Yard. Beyond these rudiments, we faced a deafening silence about acquaintance rape, relationship violence and sexual degradation. In my experience, if assaulted, most women told no one, not even our own mothers, for fear of being disbelieved, blamed or labeled as less valuable potential wives or employees.\nLucky for me, my 19-year-old sister, who had been at Harvard for a year, stopped by my dorm during freshman orientation. Sitting on my college-issue twin bed, she told me,  \"Les, this is what's gonna happen.  A cute guy, probably a football or hockey player, is going to come up to you at a party.  It's gonna feel great, like he really likes you.  He's going to ask you to go to his room for some reason.  Just don't go, no matter what. OK?\"\nTwo nights later, I went to my class ice cream social. A boy with ice-blue eyes and straight black hair, wearing a Harvard hockey jersey, flirted and told me about a better party hosted by upperclassmen from the team. Did I want to go? Sure, I agreed, flattered. Would this be my first Harvard boyfriend? He put his hand on the small of my back, steadying me as I threw my ice cream cone in the trash as we left.\n\"Just one thing,\" Mr. Blue Eyes said as we walked down the worn marble steps from the freshman union. \"It's getting cold. I need to stop by my room to get a sweatshirt. OK?\"\nRemembering my sister's words, I stammered some excuse and rushed back inside. I'm grateful I never found out if I could have been assaulted that night. But over four years at Harvard, I discovered other truths: that (if their experiences were anything like those surveyed for the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey) as many as close to 20% of my classmates were victims of rape or attempted rape, that we were most at risk during freshman year and that the real threat came not from strange men infiltrating campus, but from classmates in my coed dorm, in the carrels next to me at Widener Library and sitting behind me in Marjorie Garber's Shakespeare class. \nIf a 19-year-old like my sister knew we were vulnerable, why didn't the smart, seasoned folks running Harvard? If they knew, why didn't they protect students? The painful answer is that many administrators at Harvard, UVA and other campuses surely did know then, and do know now, the risks students face. Yet too little has been done to prevent sexual violence on campuses. Universities apparently fear that confronting assault will hurt a school's reputation, so they repeatedly leave students vulnerable. \nSo bravo, Harvard, for taking a stand to right years of wrongs, by declaring publicly that written and verbal degradation of women is intolerable, a gateway to more serious behavior. There's more to be done to end sexual assault and discrimination, but this is a step forward. And shame on those who dodge chances to raise awareness about intimate violence, and the people who try to tell the messy, complex truths about rape culture in dorm rooms, bedrooms, and boardrooms today. Every school, employer, family and bystander has one simple obligation when it comes to sexual assault: to protect everyone from it.\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "Leslie Morgan Steiner writes that extended media coverage of sexual assault is a positive step forward because it means we're finally talking about the issue.

Indeed the U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to take up the issue in the case of a transgender high school student in Virginia who is seeking to use the boys' bathroom at school. \nWhat does all of this present?  An opportunity to build a better society by building a better bathroom -- one that moves away from the common view that bathroom privacy is about gender privacy and that communal bathrooms are OK if they are gender-separated.  \nIn my religious tradition (Jewish) and the tradition of other faiths as well, there is a different approach to bathroom ethics:  Bathroom time is private time and no one else, no matter what gender, should be with you in the bathroom, unless you need help.\nOur society should build unisex, single-room mini-bathrooms for all, like the kind you find in an airplane. These bathrooms would address not only the issue of transgender bathroom usage, but also of privacy concerns generally. \nYour house (and mine, too) has a unisex private bathroom, as do restaurants, shops, and many other establishments. The truth is that such bathrooms are more modest in every way than communal facilities, which at best are only semi-private and which many find uncomfortable and even immodest.\nNothing is ever gained by public bathrooms. Humans are private creatures and bathrooms are private spaces. Unisex bathrooms not only accommodate the needs of individuals with so many special needs, but they address the needs of those among us who are simply shy to use bathroom facilities when others are present. \nThis is so important in a good society: Independent of the transgender issues, communal bathroom layouts have long marginalized the privacy needs of children and adults who need assistance, including those with disabilities. \nOf course, this is a vital concern to all who think that the needs of the weak or disabled are the deep moral imperative. Unisex mini-bathrooms would protect the dignity of these individuals. They and their caregivers (especially of the opposite sex) would be freed from the critical comments they might encounter when using gendered public facilities.\nConversely, those patrons who are uncomfortable with the presence of an opposite-sex person in a bathroom, regardless of age or disability, would be accommodated.\nIf we all adopt this plan, the bathroom areas of public places would resemble the bathrooms we are all used to in our homes: They will be a room suitable for either gender, with a toilet. Everyone has their own private space. If showers are provided, each shower would be completely self-contained. Communal showers would (and should) disappear -- they are a gross intrusion on privacy, as everyone knows.\nNo question, retrofitting millions of public bathrooms across the country to make them private may seem like too monumental a thing to ask or expect. But there are many bathroom adjustments smaller businesses could make quickly to address a social need without creating a prohibitive expense.\nNot surprisingly, many businesses have already instituted these unisex mini-bathrooms, since they are efficient and employees value their bathroom privacy\nBeyond that, the change to unisex bathrooms could be incorporated into building codes, and as with all changes to building code -- such as requirements to provide access for people with disabilities -- government agencies routinely do not mandate that every structure be brought up to code immediately. Rather, all new buildings could be expected to comply at the time of construction, and all existing buildings could be brought up to code at the time of renovation. \nIt would move us in the right direction.\nFighting over who uses which genders' bathroom, or over the \"true gender\" of transitioning individuals, misses a wonderful occasion to build a better culture for us all.  For the purpose of bathroom access, it ought to be irrelevant to debate the status of transgender people, or what a person's supposedly \"true\" gender really is under American law. \nIn fact, it is even irrelevant, whether the issue is of transgender, disability and caregiver access, or simply a situation in which an opposite-sex parent is helping a child new to the bathroom. We need a solution that protects the dignity and privacy of every person in a bathroom.\nLet's build a better bathroom.\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "The conflict over transgender bathrooms should be addressed with private, unisex bathrooms for all, says Michael Broyde.", "site": "cnn", "url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/28/opinions/the-bathroom-issue-were-not-talking-about/index.html", "title": "Transgender bathroom issue: a solution?"}, "88": {"text": " The news follows complaints from potential shoppers that the new MacBook Pro laptop isn't compatible with current device accessories. \n Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) suite of new MacBook Pro computers, which was announced last week, only include USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports.

The sky was that picture-postcard blue. The US flag and Cubs banners flying high above centerfield.\nIt was a beautiful afternoon.\nAnd, yes. Afternoon. They still played games early in the day back then.\nAlthough the war had just ended, they still played by the wartime league rules, meaning, they didn't use the traditional 2-3-2 game pattern, but instead the now-uncommon 3-4. And even though the teams didn't fly then, there were no travel days given. \nTrain travel had been restricted during World War II to keep train tracks clear for military use. It was not unusual in those days to see a troop train passing by or a freight train with war material. To support the war effort, Major League Baseball had minimized team travel.\nSo even though the war had just ended, the Series that year didn't move to Wrigley Field till the fourth game. \nI distinctly remember arriving at Wrigley Field with my father that day. Our seats were incredible; they were almost measured-out, midpoint on the first base line, only two or three rows back from the field. \nThe players were close; and when I say close, I mean hold-out-your-arm-straight-in-front-of-you-and-you-could-touch-them close. It was a thrill to be so near.\nWhen Hank Greenberg -- who had just been discharged from military service and was back playing left field -- jogged in at the end of one of the Cubs' turns at bat,  the future Hall of Famer was so close that if he hadn't stopped and turned left to step down into the Tigers dugout, he'd have bumped into the railing right in front of us. \nGreenberg was one of the few from the old days playing that day. The others were all gone. Some had retired. Some had been traded.

But that didn't matter. I was watching the Chicago Cubs and the Detroit Tigers play in the World Series at Wrigley Field, generally recognized as one of most beautiful ballparks in the land. Nothing could compare to that. \nThe Cubs had come home to Wrigley for Game 4 with a lead over the Tigers but they lost three of their four games there.  \nEven though I wasn't a Cubs fan at that game all those years ago, I can share the sentiment often sung by the beloved, longtime Cubs announcer Harry Caray, for whom \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" was almost a trademark: \"Let me root, root, root for the home team...\" \nThis time, 71 years later, it's the Cubbies' turn. \n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "Val Lauder describes what it was like to attend the 1945 World Series, and how she feels watching the Cubs finally make it to Wrigley Field again, 71 years later.

The news pulled at the heartstrings of everyone who grew up in the '80s, evoking memories of sitting on the carpet of your childhood home and defeating King Bowser in the final level of Mario Bros. \n More than three decades later, Nintendo (NTDOF) has stuffed 30 of its classic games -- from all the Mario Bros. franchises to Legends of Zelda, Pac-Man and Castlevania -- into one mini console (5 inches x 4 inches x 1.6 inches). The system, due out November 11, serves them up in a Netflix-style menu that makes it easy for scrolling. You won't find a single physical game cartridge included. \n Considering those games have been available for download on Nintendo's Wii system for years, it was unclear if packing them into a retro-style console was a gimmick or something worth the $60 price tag. \n But the magic of classic Nintendo is unquestionably preserved in this mini system. I can't remember reviewing another product that's made me smile quite as much. \n The USB-powered system comes with one controller -- the second is sold separately ($10). But it's possible to switch to two-player mode and trade off using the same controller. Set up is easy: Plug it into an outlet or your computer and connect the HDMI cable to a TV or monitor. \n \n Also included: gritty graphics, familiar music and the satisfaction of recalling which green pipes in Mario Bros. transport you to coin-filled secret lairs. \n Once you've powered up the system, you'll select from one of three display options: \"Pixel Perfect,\" which gives you a modern sharper image; a 4:3 aspect ratio mode; and another that slightly (and purposefully) distorts the picture for nostalgia's sake. \n The games hold up, if you can get past the simplicity and old-school graphics. But what makes the experience special is that you're playing through the iconic console itself. \n \n If you purchase an original Nintendo classic console on eBay now, it will cost at least $100 -- and that's before investing in games. The fact that the NES mini puts everything you need into one portable package is not only convenient but also cost efficient. \n While there's a lot to love about the console, there are a few areas in need of improvement. The short length of the controller's cord isn't optimized for sitting on the couch -- perhaps that's why we always played on the floor years ago. \n The system also doesn't connect to the internet. This means it's not upgradable. You'll be satisfied with 30 games, but it limits Nintendo from ever pushing out other titles, features or updates. \n Nintendo isn't too concerned about this; after all, it's saving the real innovation for its Nintendo Switch console -- part mobile, part home system -- coming in early 2017. \n But overall, the old adage holds up for Nintendo's throwback console: Good things really do come in small packages. \n", "tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "Nintendo Classic Edition review: So much nostalgia packed into one little console", "site": "cnn", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/04/technology/nintendo-nes-classic-edition-review/index.html", "title": "Nintendo Classic Edition review: It's worth the hype"}, "91": {"text": "Everybody's doing it, and while it is easy, it helps us change the subject and ignore the harder issues facing African-Americans.\nWhat is unfolding in that city, of course, and is receiving national attention, is the aftermath of the death of Freddie Gray, 25, who died of a \"very tragic injury to his spinal cord,\" according to Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez. The exact cause of those injuries remain under investigation. Gray family lawyer said the 25-year-old's \"spine was 80% severed\" while in police custody.\nThe circumstances around the man's killing and public outrage in the black community have led to peaceful protests.\nAnd unfortunately, though understandably, things have boiled over, with riots and looting by some. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard, and Baltimore schools were closed.\nAnd people have lined up to condemn the riots, the looting, and the violence. For example, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was in front of the cameras Monday night referring to the rioters as \"thugs.\" \n\"What we see tonight that is going on in our city is very disturbing,\" the mayor said. \"It is very clear there is a difference between what we saw over the past week with the peaceful protests, those who wish to seek justice, those who wish to be heard and want answers, and the difference between those protests and the thugs who only want to incite violence and destroy our city.\"\nPresident Obama also referred to the riot participants as \"thugs.\"\nIn an interview with CNN's Don Lemon, Gov. Hogan   seemed to channel his inner 1950s Southern governor. \"What we've now seen is outside agitators, gangs and just really thugs as the mayor called them, that are out there threatening people, injuring people and destroying property, and we're not going to put up with it,\" Hogan said before he and Mayor Rawlings-Blake walked away from the interview when Lemon's questioning apparently became a little too difficult for them.\nAnd Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, blamed the violence on \"breakdown in the family structure, the lack of fathers and the lack of moral code in our society.\" He added: \"The mayor obviously could have been stronger with saying: 'We are going to secure the city. We are not going to have thievery. We are not going to have thuggery.' \" He then added, \"None of this excuses thuggery and thievery.\"\nWhenever there is a killing of an unarmed black person by police, typically, the victim is demonized as a thug, as are the protesters and rioters who react to the killing.\nThis is because black people are viewed in their entirety as criminals. Whites who protest or riot are not called thugs, because the word thug serves as a proxy for the N-word, whether it's black or white people using the descriptors.\n\"No, it's not the right word to call our children thugs,\" Baltimore City Council member Carl Stokes told CNN's Erin Burnett. \"These are children who have been set aside, marginalized, who have not been engaged by us.\"\n\"But how does that justify what they did?\" Burnett asked Stokes. \"That's a sense of right and wrong. They know it's wrong to steal and burn down a CVS and an old persons' home. I mean, come on.\"\n\"Come on? Just call them n****rs. Just call them n****rs,\" Stokes exclaimed in frustration.\nSome leaders slam 'thug' as the new n-word\nBut as people line up to condemn the unrest and lecture so-called thugs on how to behave, few condemn the oppressive conditions, the unjust policies, the structural racism, the police brutality and the poverty that have plagued Baltimore for years. And if the looting of the CVS disturbs you more than the alleged severing of a man's spine, then you have lost your humanity, and your priorities are all wrong.\n\"When I go to Baltimore, on the East Coast, I'm dealing with 1950s-level black-and-white racism,\" Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told a White House task force on policing. \"It's taken a step back. Everything's either black or everything's white, and we're dealing with that as a community.\"\nMr. Gray's death was the breaking point, but it was a long time coming.\nAs the Baltimore Sun reported, the city has paid about $5.7 million since 2011 in over 100 police brutality lawsuits and $5.8 million in legal fees. The police have beaten, maimed and killed their victims, which include children, a pregnant mother, a 65-year-old church deacon and an 87-year-old grandmother -- mostly African-American. \nAnd as Bill Quigley wrote in the Huffington Post, the disturbing statistics about daily life in Baltimore are more shocking than recent events. \nThe poverty rate is 23.8%.  White babies born in Baltimore will have a life expectancy six years longer than black babies. Black babies are nine times more likely to die before their first birthday than white babies. The high school graduation rate for Baltimore City schools is 56.4%. \nAgain, the numbers are downright disturbing.   \nMeanwhile, in the midst of Baltimore urban rebellion, some voices have invoked the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his commitment to a strategy of nonviolence. However, they fail to mention what Dr. King said about riots:\n\"It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.\"\nJohn Angelos, COO of the Baltimore Orioles, echoed King's words:\n\"I agree ... that the principle of peaceful, nonviolent protest and the observance of the rule of law is of utmost importance in any society. MLK, Gandhi, Mandela and all great opposition leaders throughout history have always preached this precept.\"\nThat said, my personal concern, outrage and sympathy isn't focused on one night's property damage, but on the past four-decades during which an American political elite has shipped middle class and working class jobs away from Baltimore and American cities to China and other countries, plunged tens of millions of good, hard-working Americans into economic devastation, and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every American's civil rights protections in order to control an unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state.\nWe need to keep in mind that people are suffering and dying around the U.S., and while we are thankful no one was injured at Camden Yards, there is a far bigger picture for poor Americans in Baltimore and everywhere who don't have jobs and are losing economic, civil and legal rights, and this makes inconvenience at a ballgame irrelevant.\nAs we watch the events unfold in Baltimore, not unlike Ferguson -- and Los Angeles 20 years ago, and cities such as Detroit, Watts and Newark which experienced urban rebellions sparked by acts of police brutality in the 1960s -- shaming the rioters is the easy way out when we refuse to address black suffering.\nIt is clear that no expense will be spared in bringing America's military might to bear on the black folks of Baltimore. But where were the resources to eliminate poverty and unemployment and end predatory policing in the black community?\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "In light of the current unrest in Baltimore, riot shaming seems to be the new fad.", "site": "cnn", "url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/29/opinions/david-love-thugs-riot-shaming/index.html", "title": "Calling people 'thugs' solves nothing"}, "92": {"text": " The city is exploring possible routes for the first ever Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system that uses a pipeline to carry passengers and goods in levitating capsules. \n \"[Dubai] is our number one priority so we will do everything to make that happen,\" said Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd, speaking after signing the company's first commercial deal with local transport authorities. \n Hyperloop One is also considering the feasibility of building tracks in other countries, including Russia, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.K. \n But Dubai now has a head start and its first passenger track could be operating by 2021. \n One of the routes being considered -- between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates -- is 102 miles and typically takes more than an hour by car.

The police then dropped military-grade explosives on the house, burning an entire city block to the ground.\nFast forward to today, and that deadly, violent chapter provides valuable lessons for a society that so far has decided to ignore them.  \nMOVE was a revolutionary black power group founded in 1972. The group had a \"back to nature,\" almost religious element to its lifestyle -- members were vegans and animal lovers, shunned technology, and wore their hair in dreadlocks.  Their appearance and way of life led to conflict and tension in the community, and in a city with a long history of racism, police brutality, corruption and framings \u2014 and surveillance and harassment of political organizations such as the Black Panthers \u2014 the Philadelphia Police Department depicted MOVE as a terror threat.\nIn 1977, Mayor Frank Rizzo ordered a police barricade of MOVE headquarters. After 15 months, on August 8, 1978, the police moved in. One police officer was killed, in what Philadelphia Tribune reporter Linn Washington, who was on the scene, concluded was an act of police gunfire.  \nNine MOVE members were convicted of third degree murder, conspiracy and other charges, with sentences ranging between 30 and 100 years. They remain in prison. But three officers charged in the videotaped beating of a MOVE member were found not guilty.\nThis set the stage for the bombing seven years later, a sequence of events depicted in the 2014 PBS documentary, \"Let the Fire Burn.\"\nOn May 12, 1985, with the district attorney having prepared warrants to evict MOVE members from their home, police evacuated the entire block and told residents not to return for 24 hours. SWAT teams converged on the area, and gas and water lines were shut off.\nThe police pumped water and tear gas and later fired thousands of rounds of ammunition into the MOVE home, claiming MOVE had fired on police with automatic weapons, yet none of the four firearms found in the home were automatic weapons.\nAt the suggestion of a member of the police bomb squad, a state police helicopter dropped a bag of C-4 explosives on the roof of the MOVE home -- in a residential area.\nSix children were among the 13 people in the MOVE house during the bombing. Mayor Wilson Goode, then the city's first black mayor, later testified he was fully aware the device would be used but said he gave an order to put out the fire.\n\"Commissioner (Gregore) Sambor said to me, he said, 'Let's let the bunker burn, to eliminate that high ground advantage and that tactical advantage of the bunker,' and I said OK,\" testified Fire Commissioner William Richmond at a hearing after the bombing.\nSome of the officers involved in the 1978 MOVE operation were involved in the 1985 operation. It was also alleged that people who attempted to flee from the burning building, including children, were shot at by police. \nOnly two people -- one woman, Ramona Africa, and a child, Birdie Africa, also known as Michael Moses Ward -- survived the destruction of Osage Avenue. \"N****r lover\" was reportedly written on the police locker of James Berghaier, the officer who helped the burned child out of the house. Berghaier subsequently left the force due to a stress disorder.\nA federal judge awarded the survivors $1.5 million, and a commission found that city officials were negligent and police training and supervision were lacking. However, no government officials or police officers were prosecuted for their role in the bombing.\nSadly, the MOVE bombing provided a preview of police state tactics that are commonplace today, and a militarization of local police forces, brought about by the wars on drugs and terror and funded by asset forfeiture and the feds. Indeed, law enforcement is using weaponry utilized by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under the Defense Department's 1033 program, along with similar Department of Justice and Homeland Security programs, the cops receive free surplus military arms, aircraft, Humvees, mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, you name it.  \nGive wannabe soldiers with no training all the military hardware they want. What could possibly go wrong? \nWell, people die, and children are endangered, such as 19-month old \"Bou Bou\" Phonesavanh, who was hit with a flash-bang grenade during a raid by police looking for drugs that did not exist. The child was placed in a medically induced coma, leaving the family with a $1 million medical bill.\nAddressing police militarization in the wake of events in Ferguson, Missouri, Sen. Claire McCaskill and Rep. William Lacy Clay, both Missouri Democrats, are introducing legislation to require more training and oversight for police departments receiving military equipment from federal programs and ban the use of certain surplus by local police. \nUnfortunately, the Fraternal Order of Police opposes any attempt to restrict the equipment used by law enforcement. This blue mentality that justifies and protects the police without criticism -- even as crime decreases -- threatens to further isolate the profession, as Radley Balko suggested recently in the Washington Post.  \nThirty years after MOVE, the concept of policing must change. A recent Department of Justice report found serious deficiencies in the Philadelphia police on policies and training on the use of deadly force and a lack of public trust in the police policing themselves.  \nNoting an increase in police-involved shootings as crime has dropped, the report called for more police accountability and community oversight, independent and consistent investigations of police shootings, training in handling violent encounters and de-escalating tense situations.\nIn the meantime, black and brown communities across the country, particularly poor and working people, bear the brunt of heavy-handed police tactics. Regularly monitored and harassed, they are fearful and suspicious of police, and with good reason, because police behave like an occupying army in many of their neighborhoods.  \nIt stands to reason that in white communities -- where law enforcement plays a different role -- police generally do not behave as they have carried on in the unrest in Ferguson last year, or Baltimore this year, or in West Philly in 1985. Yet the militarization of the police should concern everyone. Resisting the abuses of an oppressive government is an issue that should resonate with opposite ends of the political spectrum. Dismissing the victims of police brutality as violent black thugs who deserved their fate is delusional. \nUltimately, no one is safe if any one of us is not safe. \nAs in any police state, when the police become the army, they need an enemy, and the enemy ends up being us. \"To serve and protect\" is becoming \"to suppress and control.\" \nAnd with billions of dollars in military surplus, the police will find a way to use it.\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "As in any police state, when the police become the army, they need an enemy, and the enemy ends up being us.", "site": "cnn", "url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/13/opinions/love-move-bombing-anniversary/index.html", "title": "The dangerous militarization of our police"}, "94": {"text": " The company announced new apps and features for its products to coincide with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

CVS (CVS) also warned that earnings for the fourth quarter and all of 2017 would be worse than expected. \n Shares plunged nearly 15% on the news. \n The biggest problem for CVS appears to be increased competition from rival Walgreens (WBA), which now owns European pharmacy giant Boots and is also in the process of buying Rite Aid (RAD). \n CVS said that it expects to lose more than 40 million prescriptions. \n CEO Larry Merlo said that some prescriptions have begun \"migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter\" and that the company is \"currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market.\" \n CVS bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark a few years ago, a deal that may be backfiring on the company. CVS may be alienating some companies who are worried about how much power it holds in the prescription drug business. \n Walgreens has sought to take advantage of those fears. It has partnered with Caremark rival Optum Rx, which is owned by insurance giant UnitedHealth (UNH). \n Walgreens also has a strategic alliance with Prime Therapeutics, the mail order unit of more than a dozen Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans. \n Another pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts (ESRX), announced at the end of September that Walgreens will replace CVS as the drug store of choice for Tricare, a prescription plan that Express Scripts runs for members of the U.S. military. \n CVS is trying to diversify its business to deal with these competitive threats. The company has also bought Omnicare, a company that runs pharmacies for nursing homes. CVS also now runs in-store pharmacies at Target. (TGT) \n But many analysts believe that CVS has paid too much attention to its pharmacy benefits and mail order businesses -- at the expense of improving its own stores. \n CVS said same-store sales at the front end of its pharmacies fell 1% in the quarter. The company blamed weak traffic. \n Meanwhile, Walgreens has won raves for investing more in the front end of the store, i.e. beauty care, food, toys and other items. \n \"CVS is missing out on growth that could be easily attained by a slightly more imaginative approach to its front of store business,\" said Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino, in a report. \n \"We continue to be disappointed that the group cannot see the front of house opportunity,\" he added. \n It's a problem that CVS needs to quickly address before the problem gets worse.

But -- despite all the odds -- he has never given up on his quest to become a champion, and achieved that goal by a single point in the final race of his Olympic regatta in the Nacra 17 Mixed Multihull, with sailing partner Cecilia Carranza Saroli.\nLange shakes his head in disbelief at the reaction both in Brazil -- \"I must surely be the first Argentinian that Brazilians have cheered,\" he jokes -- and back at home.\n\"Even now it's still crazy. I took a plane in Argentina, the captain spotted me and announced over the system. Everyone on the plane stood up and clapped,\" he says.\n\"And if I'm on a toll road, I'm not allowed to pay a toll. It seems it has had an impact on a lot of people, and everyone seems so happy about our success.\"\nThat Lange was able to even make it to the start line, let alone be celebrating a golden finale, is down to medical ingenuity and his own remarkably rapid recovery.\nHe was diagnosed with cancer in March 2015, but dithered over the medical advice for surgery to remove a lung because \"the problem is I like to use my lung!\"\nThe operation left him with just 20% use of his left lung -- hardly ideal for the potential exertions of an Olympian -- but Rio, whether realistic or not, became a carrot dangled in front of him.\nDespite eight hours of surgery, the next day he was up walking around. Five days later he was at home and walking five kilometers a day. From day 10 to 30 of his recovery, he cycled 450 km with his sons.\nBy November last year -- 41 days after surgery -- he was back in the boat.\n\"The beginning was enormously tough,\" he recalls. \"Really from then until May or June was so tough because you have to be fit and able to breathe to work your brain.\n\"And it made me grumpy all the time. Really, Ceci deserves a second gold medal for putting up with me!\"\nBy the time they got to Rio, gold seemed possible -- but their initial target was just to finish higher than fourth, so Lange could at least add to his previous two Olympic bronze medals.\nIn the dramatic deciding race, the Argentines were penalized and dropped to the rear of the fleet before clawing their way back to sixth. Placing any lower, they would have lost the gold.\nThere was no immediate celebration -- they weren't sure where they had finished. Lange recalls thinking he'd missed out on a medal altogether before journalists on a nearby boat relayed the news.\n\"There was no words, really, just in my mind an absolute feeling of happiness,\" he says. \"It was a sensational moment.\"\nHave your say on our Facebook page\nWatching on the shoreline were his 87-year-old mother and his brothers, while his sons Yago and Klaus -- also part of Argentina's sailing team -- swam out to meet his boat for an emotional celebration.\n\"Luckily, Ceci spotted them,\" he adds. \"All Games are very emotional but to be at an Olympic Games opening ceremony with your sons and then to win gold like that was so special.\n\"We'd spent so much time in Rio beforehand that we had lots of Brazilians cheering for us as well.\"\nLange was given a cellphone for an interview back in Argentina -- it was left on, and the rest of his family's celebrations played out to a massive public audience. Two months on, it is still often replayed.\nMuch of the past weeks have been spent at home, where Lange has pursued his other job as a naval architect. He studied the subject in England and has just finished building his own motorboat with a hybrid engine as a hobby.\nHis prowess on the design side and on the water also saw him enlisted by Artemis Racing for the Swedish team's 2013 America's Cup campaign, which was hit by the tragic death of Andrew \"Bart\" Simpson in San Francisco Bay.\n\"That's one of the hardest moments of my life,\" Lange says, as his usually upbeat voice turns solemn. \"I was there that day and it's hard because we know how much of a great man Bart was. He was a great sailor but also a great friend to everyone, and that was so, so tough.\"\nThe effervescent Simpson would certainly have been among the first to congratulate Lange on his Olympic triumph.\nAt his age, surely that is the end for him at the Games? He jokes he has to carry on as \"it helps me remember my life every four years\" -- but he is serious when he says Tokyo 2020 is his new ambition.\nVisit cnn.com/sailing for more news and videos\n\"I do it for the love of sailing -- the outcome is just a positive side effect,\" he concludes. \"I love sailing and I love the Olympic Games.

It boasts six of the world's top 10 ranked players and 40 of the top 100.\nA fiercely competitive society married with an intrinsic dedication to getting better has fostered a generation of women that has transformed and revolutionized the game.\n\"Koreans are the most disciplined people on earth,\" PGA coach Brian Mogg, who has an academy in Seoul, told CNN's Living Golf show.\n\"You tell them to do something but they don't just do it, they do it to the nth degree, and they do it hard and passionate. When you put hard work and discipline together you're going to create some success.\"\n'Se Ri Pak's kids'\nThe pioneer for this influx of golfing prodigies was Se Ri Pak.\nShe became the first South Korean to capture a major at the 1998 LPGA Championship. Such was her limited grasp of English at the time, Pak didn't realize it was a major until after she'd clinched the title.\nPak would go on to win a whopping 39 professional tournaments and five majors in a career that was spawned by a fastidious father who would occasionally make her spend the night alone in a cemetery to toughen her up.\nTen years after her breakthrough triumph, Pak's \"kids\" began to permeate the LPGA's ranks and started a trend that now sees its women dominate.\nThere have been 11 more major winners from the country since. \nInbee Park has seven to her name at just 28. World No. 1 Lydia Ko, a two-time major champ who won her first pro tournament aged just 14, was born in Seoul before moving to New Zealand.\n\"Se Ri has raised the standard of Korean golf and helped the careers of so many players,\" two-time major champion In Gee Chun says. \n\"Not only that, her success has lifted the whole golf industry in the country.\"\nHa Na Jang, who has three LPGA Tour victories and $2 million career earnings to her name, adds: \"Se Ri is a golfing legend in Korea. It's an honor for me to try to follow her path.\"\nA winning mentality\nSuch is the South Korean mentality, Pak's kids didn't just want to emulate their idol, they wanted to eclipse her.\nFrom an early age only those who win are rewarded, creating single minded competitors who work tirelessly to reach the peak of their profession.\n\"When I look at American players I can see that they're friends, cheering for each other,\" Jang explained. \"But there is a lot of rivalry between Korean players. They consider each other as competitors, not as a friend or fellow player.\"\n\"This sense of rivalry makes me work harder all the time,\" Chun adds. \"If I see others achieve success it makes me work harder to achieve my goals. I think everyone has that kind of competitive spirit.\" \nChan-Goog Yang, head pro at Seoul's Sky 72 club, develops the theme further.\n\"In Western culture, although the winner is important, they respect all competitors and reward them for their effort, regardless of where they finished,\" Yang says. \n\"In Korea, however, only the winner is rewarded. Only first place. This has an effect on young children who learn from an early age, no matter what form of competition, you are either a champion or nothing.\"\nSingle minded\nThis unflappable temperament is vital out on the course, when a golfer often has to battle their own mind as well as the opposition.\nTrusting your swing is imperative, and this is where a paucity of golf courses in South Korea has actually proved beneficial. Most players hone their skills on the driving range instead, which can make their swing water tight.\nAdd that to the rest of the package, and it's no wonder South Koreans are ripping it up on the links.\n\"With other sports an umpire decides whether you've won or lost,\" Yang explains. \"Whereas in golf, results can be seen straight after you hit the ball, which is why it fits so well with a Korean's character. \n\"Phrases such as \"see you later,\" \"let me see\" or \"we'll see\" -- phrases that suggest waiting -- do not suit a Korean's character. It's all about \"what I do\" and \"what I get.\" Koreans need to know what they have done and what they will receive immediately, which fits right into golf.\"\nAs world No. 12 So Yeon Ryu explains, on the rare occasion a bad shot occurs, South Koreans are well equipped to deal with it.  \n\"We all learn how to control our mind especially when you're upset or when you're happy so Koreans just naturally know how to manage your anger or your happiness because it's our culture,\" she said.\nRevitalizing the Tour\nThis surge of South Korean superstars has not only changed the golfing landscape on the course, but also revitalized its fortunes off it.\nFive years ago there were 23 events on the LPGA Tour. That numbers now stands at 33, and 14 of those are sponsored by Asian companies.\nEight of those tournaments are being staged in Asia this season, while the Korean Ladies' Professional Golf Association organizes 78 national tournaments a year with prize money totaling $20 million. \nYoung players progress through three levels of competition, and by the time they take flight towards the United States and the LPGA Tour, they are primed to prosper.\nHave your say on our Facebook page\nSo, too, is the LPGA. Its first retail store in Seoul opened recently, and it plans 100 more in South Korea by 2018.\nBut it is on the course that success will continue to be measured, and according to Mogg, the very fabric of South Korean culture is the best support the game can have.\nVisit cnn.com/golf for more news and videos\n\"It's pretty much a disciplined culture, very much an inherent and rigid way in terms of daily roles and how you follow these patterns of behavior and golf is an extension out of that,\" he said. \n\"I think that's probably at the root of why you're seeing so much success.\"\n", "tags": ["sport"], "abstract": "South Korea has dominated women's golf since Se Ri Pak's breakthrough major victory at the 1998 LPGA Championship.", "site": "cnn", "url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/02/golf/golf-korea-pak-park/index.html", "title": "South Korea: Factory of champion golfers"}, "108": {"text": "A blend of youth and experience proved to be a winning formula with youngest member Emily Moffitt, 21 and veteran John Whitaker starring alongside Bertram Allen and Eduardo Menezes. \nThe team had won four previous rounds during the 15-leg 2016 championship and were handsomely rewarded for their efforts bagging more than $8 million prize money between them. \nIt proved to be a nail-biting climax to the season in the Qatari capital with Valkenswaard United narrowly taking the overall title with 328.5 points, ahead of the Antwerp Diamonds on 326 and the Monaco Aces -- who dropped out of the title race after Daniel Bluman clocked 12 faults -- on 315.5.\nFrom the beaches of Florida to the floodlights of the spectacular Al Shaqab arena, the Valkenswaard quartet have topped the overall standings throughout the 15-leg series, having won victories in Miami, Hamburg, Monaco and Vienna.\n\"It's been brilliant, it's been a long season,\" said Bertram Allen. \"We were battling out the whole year.

He has now said he will stay until June 2019.\nIn his letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond, Mr Carney said his move should help \"contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK's new relationship with Europe\".\nDuring the referendum, Mr Carney had come under pressure from some Brexit campaigners for his remarks that voting to leave the EU would push the UK into a recession - seen by some as outside the governor's non-political remit.\nThe governor defended his intervention, saying the Bank's role was to \"identify risks, not to cross your fingers and hope risks would go away\". \nNevertheless, this sparked calls for him to resign.\nMr Carney \"never seems to want to recognise the result of the referendum and get on with it,\" said one MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, recently. \nSince his arrival three years ago, Mr Carney has presided over measures designed to boost the UK economy in the aftermath of the global economic crisis.\nThere have been bouts of quantitative easing - pumping money directly into the financial system.\nHe introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\" at the Bank, also aimed at raising confidence; though just six months after its implementation in 2013 this needed a rethink.\nThe Bank had originally said it would not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate fell to 7% or below.\nBut when that seemed likely to happen much sooner than anticipated the Bank altered its stance, saying it would focus on a range of economic variables rather than just the jobless numbers before changing rates.  \nBut Mr Carney did then give clear hints that rates would have to gradually rise towards 2017.\nInstead, the opposite has happened, and in the wake of the UK's Brexit vote the Bank actually cut rates to 0.25% this summer. \nWhen Mark Carney became the Bank of England's governor in June 2013, he was the first non-Briton to be appointed in the Bank's 300-year history.\nHe came after a successful stint as Canada's central banker, where he was credited for shielding the country from some of the worst effects of the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn March 2008, just a month after his appointment, he cut Canadian interest rates. This and other measures helped boost market confidence and enabled Canada to recover from the crisis more quickly than some of its peers.\nLikened more than once to the Hollywood actor George Clooney, ahead of his arrival in the UK Mr Carney was touted as a \"rock star\" banker, a change from the usual Bank of England head.\n\"He's got star quality, and he knows how to use it,\" said fellow Canadian and former government colleague Scott Reid.\nMr Carney's appointment was a break with tradition in many ways. \nHe had a commercial banking, as well as a public sector background - unlike his two most recent predecessors who had spent their careers within the Bank of England and academia.  \nMr Carney worked for investment banking giant Goldman Sachs in New York before returning to Canada to work for the country's Finance Department - and then Canada's central bank.\nAnother difference was the size of his pay packet, which was well above that of his predecessor, Sir Mervyn King.\nHis starting annual salary of \u00a3480,000 (plus \u00a3144,000 pension allowance) was \u00a3175,000 more than Sir Mervyn received - and that's not counting his \u00a3250,000 annual accommodation allowance.\nSo what is it about Mr Carney that separates him from other central bankers? \n\"He's extraordinarily charismatic,\" says Scott Reid. \"You go to his speeches and you'll find them just as dry as anyone's. \n\"But it's the way he does things, he takes the time to linger on you... and the public and the press find that very intoxicating.\n\"He such a fetching figure - but let's not be shy about that.

He's shrewd when it comes to his image.\"\nMarried to an Englishwoman, the 48-year-old's postgraduate education was at Oxford University, where he studied economics.\nHis former tutor during his Masters degree, economist Peter Oppenheimer, says \"he was a typically bright, transatlantic student\". \n\"That sounds terribly old fashioned, but he wasn't the sort of young man who walked around in torn sweaters.\" \nProf Oppenheimer says Mr Carney was an interesting choice to run the Bank of England. \"He wasn't an insider, he wasn't an academic economist, and he was a practical banker of a certain kind. \n\"The really good governors of the post-Second World War period have been people with practical banking experience, such as Gordon Richardson and Robin Leigh-Pemberton. \n\"They have been the outstanding governors. More so than Bank insiders, or people with long academic careers.\" \nIt's been said Mr Carney wanted to stay to help the UK through the challenges of Brexit, and that leaving early might be seen by some of his critics as admitting defeat.\nCrucially, he has the backing of the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who believes he is the right person to be Bank of England governor.\nThere is also the matter of market confidence. \nFollowing the referendum result and all the personnel changes in the Conservative government, many in the markets see Mr Carney as one of the few voices of continuity in the UK. \n", "tags": ["economy"], "abstract": "When Mark Carney became the Bank of England's governor in 2013 he was the first non-Briton to be appointed in the Bank's 300-year history.

He has suggested that Nato countries which do not pay their dues into the military alliance could lose US protection in the event of an invasion by, say, Russia.\nThe UK would not be directly affected by that, as it has met its Nato spending target. But, as the country leaves an EU moving towards closer defence and foreign policy ties, could this cause problems?\n\"A stronger Nato would suit a Brexited UK better,\" says Kori Schake, who acted as senior policy adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. \n\"But I also think he'll quickly discover how much the US gets from our allies and how important their contributions are to what the US tries to get done in the world.

Mr Trump, however, has been far more positive.\nHis trade adviser, Dan DiMicco, said last month that he \"absolutely\" wanted to do a deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit, which is set to happen in early-to-mid-2019.\n\"I could see that happening,\" says Ms Schake, \"especially since the EU seems unwilling to move forward with the US-EU deal.  \n\"A bilateral agreement with Britain could be a huge opportunity for Trump to prove he's in favour of 'the right kind of deals'.  But whether that would constitute a good deal for Britain is more difficult to say.\"\nMr Trump's election website does not mention Europe or the UK in its section on trade, focusing more on relations with China and Pacific countries.\nTheresa May did not offer an opinion on the candidate she would prefer as US president. But last year, after Mr Trump suggested that parts of London had become so radicalised that police did not dare enter, she called his remarks \"divisive, unhelpful and wrong\".\nAsked about these last month, Mrs May played down the significance of her criticism, saying: \"I made those comments in relation to some particular references he had made.\"\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has also made quips at Mr Trump's expense and MPs have even held a debate on barring him from the UK.

That was the number one challenge: how do you know it will focus in space, especially after we learned that Hubble was not quite in focus when we launched?\n\"We\u2019ve learned how to do that.\" \nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a cooperative venture between Nasa and its European and Canadian counterparts. \nWhen the contributions from all the parties are included, the value of this next-generation science facility is close to $10bn.\nWebb will carry technologies capable of detecting the light from the first stars to shine in the Universe. \nIt will also reveal in unprecedented detail the chemistry and behaviour of planets far beyond our Solar System.\nTo help achieve this, it is fitted with a mirror that has a diameter of 6.5m - roughly seven times the light-collecting area of Hubble's main mirror.\nThis reflector is so big in fact that it must be capable of folding. \nOnly by turning the edges inwards will the beryllium/gold segments fit inside the enclosure atop the Ariane.\nAfter years of development, the past 12 months have finally seen the telescope take on a recognisable form. And on Wednesday, Nasa called a media event to showcase the progress and to mark the milestone of two years to lift-off.\nSo far, everything is on track. \u201cWe\u2019re on schedule and on cost,\u201d said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden.\nAlthough we talk of the \"telescope\" being finished, this really only refers to the optical parts of the observatory - its mirrors and instruments. \nNot yet incorporated into the full structure is the spacecraft bus, or chassis - that part that includes all the housekeeping hardware like the computers, telecommunications systems, and the thrusters to maintain Webb\u2019s position in orbit. \nNor have engineers attached the giant shield that will shade Webb's observations from the light of our Sun.\n\"The sunshield is as big a tennis court,\" quipped Dr Mather. \"Try to imagine Roger Federer and Rafa (Nadal) running back and forth on our telescope.

It is also a high-risk project for them all. \nAssuming the observatory survives the dangers of launch, it will take roughly six months to prepare for use by astronomers.\nThis commissioning period will involve a number of pivotal stages such as the unpacking of the mirror and the unfurling of the five-membrane sunshield. \nWebb must then also be left to chill down to make it sensitive to the infrared light coming from the most distant stars in the cosmos.\nThose six months ahead of routine science are already being dubbed the \"six months of terror\" because of the requirement for all of the in-space deployments to go exactly to plan.  And unlike with Hubble, there will be no astronauts available to fix a problem after launch because Webb will be stationed too far away for them to reach - about 1.5 million km from Earth.\nThis underlined the need to make sure the coming months\u2019 testing was performed with care, said Dr Mather. \"We need to make sure we won\u2019t be terrified by doing our job now.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Engineers finish assembling the telescope that will succeed Hubble.

It's how you learn.\nThat is certainly the attitude being taken by the European Space Agency (Esa) in the wake of its Schiaparelli mishap.\nThe probe's telemetry is still being analysed but it looks increasingly like the Italian-built robot did not make a soft landing on Wednesday.\nQuite the contrary. It very probably hit the ground at high speed after jettisoning its parachute too early and firing its thrusters for only a few seconds.\nBut Esa is holding to the line that no firm conclusions can be drawn until a full reconstruction of events is made from the telemetry.\nAnd even if it is shown that Schiaparelli crashed, we should still consider it a partial success. The reason? We will know why it didn't work and the lessons can then be taken forward to make sure the next landing achieves a better outcome. \nTo repeat another of those mantras: \"You're allowed to fail so long as you understand why you failed.\"\nFor Esa's ExoMars programme, of which Schiaparelli was a part, the stakes could not be higher, however. \nThe next phase - the next landing - for ExoMars would see a British-assembled rover try to put down on the Red Planet in 2021.\nThis six-wheeled robot is an expensive project and is already struggling to get the full funding it needs to proceed.\nDecisions on its budget will now be clouded by what has happened this week.\nSchiaparelli was touted as the technology demonstrator - the project that would give scientists and engineers the experience, expertise and confidence to go forward with 2021.\nThey will certainly have filled their store of knowledge. By the bucket load. But will Esa member-state ministers meeting in December still have the stomach for another Mars landing, and - more to the point - the enthusiasm to part with the 300m euros that is likely needed to carry the rover project through to completion?\nIn a press conference at Esa's mission control on Thursday, the agency's director-general Jan Woerner was bullish in his assessment of how member states would react. The progress that had been made would be \"obvious\" to them, he said. We'll see.\nAt a minimum, the ministers will want the board of inquiry set up in the wake of Schiaparelli's apparent loss to report quickly, with a clear and detailed explanation of the things that went wrong and how they can be put right.\nOn the plus side, Esa officials can point to the outstanding success of getting Schiaparelli's \"mothership\" into orbit. The Trace Gas Orbiter, as it is known, has the potential to deliver some fascinating insights on Mars' atmosphere and what its rarest molecules might say about the existence of life at the Red Planet today.\nOriginally, no observations were planned for many months while the TGO tidied up its orbit. Now, mission mangers are expecting to squeeze in some early science, just in time for those end-of-year deliberations. A good performance would be timely and perhaps give the ministers a feel-good factor.\nAnd then next week, the key parties working on the rover - including their Russian partners - will conduct a major review of the status of the much-delayed project.\nThe findings also will inform the coming budget discussions.\nIt would be a massive blow to European pride if ministers decided to abandon the aspiration to land on Mars (and the cause of no little disappointment in the UK where rover prototypes have been significant \"vehicles\" for STEM inspiration and education).\nIt would also highlight Europe's deficiency in its exploration of the Solar System. \nBeyond TGO, Esa has a satellite planned for Mercury and one for Jupiter. But neither is near-term.\nThe former doesn't get to its target until the mid-2020s, and the latter doesn't start serious science until 2030. \nThere's a daring mission to fly close to the Sun that will launch in 2018, but that's not a planetary body - not one you can land on anyway. \nAnd if we've learnt anything in the past couple of years with the Rosetta comet mission, it is that the public is most engaged when probes touch down on something.\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Landing on planetary bodies is hard - as we saw with Europe's Schiaparelli probe - but it is the space endeavour that most engages the public.", "site": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37722026", "title": "Schiaparelli: The imperative to touch another world"}, "124": {"text": "Recent centuries have seen a big jump in the rates of erosion in the iconic chalk cliffs on England's south coast.\nA new study finds that for thousands of years the rocks were being beaten back by the waves at perhaps 2-6cm a year.\nThe past 150 years has seen this retreat accelerate 10-fold, to more than 20cm a year.\nThe speed-up was clocked with the aid of a smart technique that tracks changes induced in rocks when they are exposed to energetic space particles.\nThe research, led from the British Geological Survey and conducted by Martin Hurst and colleagues, is reported in the leading American journal, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe group believes the findings will help us understand some of the coming impacts of climate change.  \n\"Our coasts are going to change in the future as a result of sea-level rise and perhaps increased storminess, and we want this work to inform better forecasts of erosion,\" Dr Hurst, currently affiliated to Glasgow University, told BBC News.\nThe research was centred on East Sussex and its towering cliffs at Beachy Head and Hope Gap.\nOriginally laid down 90 million years ago, these soft chalk faces are now being eaten away by the relentless pounding they get from the sea.\nDr Hurst's team was able to estimate the pace of this reversal by examining the amount of beryllium-10 in nodules of flint embedded in the eroded platform in front of the cliffs.\nThe radioactive element is produced when cosmic rays - that constantly shower the Earth - hit oxygen atoms in the flints' quartz minerals.\nThe longer the nodules have been exposed, the greater their build-up of beryllium-10.\nAt Beachy Head and Hope Gap, the gently sloping platform, which is only uncovered at low tide, extends seaward several hundred metres.\nIt represents all that is left after millennia of cliff removal. \n\"The lower rates of erosion that we report - about 2.5cm at Hope Gap and around 6cm at Beachy Head - are averaged over that timeframe - through about the past 7,000 years of the Holocene,\" explained Dr Hurst.\n\"But comparing that to observations based on topographic maps and aerial photography of the last 150 years - the difference is quite stark. These historical observations from 1870 to the present suggest erosion rates of 20-30cm a year at the two sites.\"\nThe estimates of change in the deep past are tricky because the platform appears younger than it really is.\nThis stems from the fact that its surface continues to erode downwards, removing its oldest exposed flints. The regular tidal covering of water also has to be considered because it will restrict the flux of cosmic rays reaching the platform, thus limiting the amount of beryllium that can be induced in the nodules.\nBut the team is confident in its analysis and puts forward some ideas to explain the recent big up-tick in erosion.\nThese concern the available gravels at the foot of the cliffs that constitute the beach.\nOrdinarily, this material acts as a buffer, limiting the energy of crashing waves.\nBut there is good evidence that the beaches in this region of the south coast have got thinner through time and perhaps therefore offer less protection today than they once did.\nIn the modern era, groynes and sea walls have been erected further down the coast and these may have interfered with the along-shore transport of gravels. And further back in time, several hundred years ago, it is possible also that there was a phase of more storms. These could have removed significant volumes of gravel and pushed the rates of erosion into a new, more aggressive regime that persists even now.\nCo-author Dr Dylan Rood from Imperial College London told BBC News: \"The coast is clearly eroding, and Britain has retreated fast. A nearly tenfold increase in retreat rates over a very short timescale, in geological terms, is remarkable. \n\"The UK cannot leave the issue of cliff erosion unresolved in the face of a warming world and rising sea levels.

But it could yet turn around for Hamilton.\nRosberg is playing the calculated game, which is exactly the right thing to do. His job is to win the World Championship. And no-one in six months' time will remember or care whether he won it by finishing second in the last four grands prix.\nHamilton has had the worst of the luck with reliability at Mercedes, but equally he has let himself down with a couple of shaky weekends and some bad starts.\nBut you can point at problems Rosberg has had in free practice, or some of his weak races, such as Monaco.\nUltimately, whoever is champion deserves it. And if you win a world title by beating Hamilton in the same car in races, then you have not done a bad job.\nWhen Hamilton is on his game, he has that little bit of an extra edge. But he is not always on his game, and that is what gives Rosberg hope.\nAnd you have to say that, after being given a kicking last year, Rosberg has left no stone unturned in his pursuit of this year's title.\nIf Hamilton pulls this back from the position he is in, it will have been a masterful achievement. And Rosberg has to be careful at the next race in Brazil on 11-13 November.\nKnowing he can be champion that weekend if he wins will make it all the harder for him to follow his one-race-at-a-time approach.\nWorld championships are won and lost in the head. The closer the championship gets, the more nervy a driver becomes.\nRosberg does not have to attack - he knows he can take the cautious approach.\nBut I expect Red Bull to be pretty strong at Interlagos. Their Renault engine has improved a lot recently, and the car will be quick through the twisty middle sector.\nEqually, Brazil often throws up a chaotic race, not least because the weather is so changeable.\nIt is the highest risk for Rosberg not to finish second or third, which he needs to do to stop Hamilton taking back control. A good example was 2012, when Sebastian Vettel was so nearly taken out in a first-lap collision, but survived and hung on to the championship by the skin of his teeth as his rival Fernando Alonso finished second but did not quite make up enough ground.\nThe Mexican Grand Prix ended in something close to farce. In more than 30 years in motorsport, I have never seen such a crazy situation as three people finishing third in an F1 race.\nVerstappen crossed the line third but was demoted before he got to the podium. A frustrated Vettel went to the podium and therefore had to answer all the questions he did not want to be asked. And then he found out he, too, had been penalised and the guy who finished fifth, Verstappen's team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, was ultimately classified third.\nIt was a strange race, in that a manic first lap and crazy finish - produced by the various tyre strategies of Verstappen, Vettel and Ricciardo - bookended what was in between a pretty dull grand prix.\nThe series of controversial incidents during the race in Mexico City have led to a lot of discussion about Formula 1's rules and regulations in such circumstances.\nMany people - including Verstappen himself - have pointed out what they see as a contradiction between the fact that race-winner Hamilton did not receive a penalty for cutting across the grass at Turns One and Two on the first lap, and that Verstappen did for doing it later in the race.\nI have been an official driver steward at a number of grands prix. And the way the rules are operated - and all the drivers and teams know about this - there was no contradiction.\nFirstly, the start and first lap are treated differently from the rest of the race. That's not to say you can get away with anything - as was proved when Carlos Sainz was penalised for pushing Fernando Alonso on to the grass - dirty driving is still dirty driving and will be punished.\nBut little incidents, details of driving, are tolerated that would not be during the main part of the race, simply because it's an inevitably more hectic environment with so many cars together at the same time.\nOn the first lap, Hamilton locked a wheel and ran wide at Turn One. He cut across the grass and rejoined in Turn Two.\nThere were several reasons why he was not given a penalty: it was the first lap, when there is more latitude; he was not fighting with anyone - he was clearly in the lead and the battle was for second behind him; and he lifted off as soon as he rejoined the track.\nThat was quick and clear thinking from Hamilton and it was crucial because the stewards work on the basis of a rule that dictates a driver must not gain a \"lasting advantage\" by going off the track.\nThe lock-up and flat spot meant Hamilton ended up in a risky situation - it means big vibrations that not only shake the driver around but also risk breaking the suspension.\nThis famously happened to Kimi Raikkonen at the Nurburgring in 2005. He led much of the way, ran a long time on a tyre with a flat-spot on it, and the suspension shattered on the very last lap of the race.\nVerstappen fitted his medium tyres to take him to the end of the race on lap 12, whereas Vettel did not stop until lap 33 - so had tyres with 21 laps less wear on them.\nComing up behind them was Ricciardo, who fitted new soft tyres on lap 51, with only 20 laps to go.\nOn old medium tyres, it is easier to lose tyre temperature on long straights, which was almost certainly a contributing factor to Verstappen locking up at the start of lap 68.\nHe went off the track and across the grass within half a metre or so of the line Hamilton had been on at the start. \nCould he have got the car back on to the track? Almost certainly. But he would have lost at least one position to Vettel and probably another to Ricciardo as well.\nThe problem was that going across the grass meant he gained and kept a lasting advantage as opposed to losing one. Hence the penalty.\nVerstappen's refusal to give the place to Vettel set up Ricciardo's attack on the German on the penultimate lap, as the Ferrari was being held back to the Dutchman's pace.\nRicciardo got a good run on Vettel out of Turn Two and I was surprised that Vettel did not move to the inside earlier to cover and try to send him around the outside - especially as he said afterwards he knows Ricciardo will often have an \"optimistic\" attempt, without question or hesitancy.\nThat gave Ricciardo a chance to have a go down the inside and he went for it at the exact moment they were coming into the braking area.\nVettel started to close the space in the braking area. This is something that has been discussed at a lot of drivers' briefings this season, predominantly in the context of Verstappen's driving.\nA new clarification was brought out at the US Grand Prix, the week before Mexico, spelling out what was acceptable in this area.\nThe FIA said drivers' could not make any change in direction in the braking area that led to another driver having to take evasive action.\nWhy is this area so sensitive? Think back to the Australian Grand Prix at the start of the season. There, owing to a misunderstanding in the braking area, Fernando Alonso's McLaren was launched over Esteban Gutierrez's Haas into an almighty accident.\nThose are the risks of moving in the braking area.\nSo it was hardly surprising that the move was investigated and Vettel ended up being penalised.\nThe stewards did well to give Verstappen his penalty early enough before the podium ceremony; it was just a shame they could not manage that in time to get Ricciardo up on to the podium.\nVettel has escaped sanction for the expletive-laden tirade he launched over the radio in the race.\nBut he has to bear in mind that he now has six penalty points on his licence - and if any driver gets 12 in any 12-month period, that is an automatic one-race ban.\nThe Vettel we are seeing now - both in and out of the car - is not the same man who won four consecutive world titles with Red Bull, or even who won three races for Ferrari last year.\nFerrari came into this season expecting to challenge Mercedes, but it has been a disappointing year, with questionable strategy and technical errors. \nIt looked for a while as if Vettel might win the opening race of the season in Australia, only for the team to make a bad strategic call when the race was stopped for Alonso's accident. Another potential victory went begging in Canada for similar reasons.\nThey have been leapfrogged by Red Bull - Vettel's former team - and only at seven of the 19 races so far this year has Ferrari's gap to pole position been closer than it was in 2015.\nIt has become a very frustrating season and there is no question there is a lot of pressure on that team.\nEmotions are running high, and you can hear it in Vettel's radio messages, about slower drivers, blue flags, people blocking him - all expressed in the manner of someone who is very frustrated.\nYes, they are being broadcast. But they are being broadcast because he is making them. If he didn't, they couldn't broadcast them.\nHis comments about FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting - even though they were rooted in the fact that he felt no action was being taken about Verstappen, whose driving Vettel has been unhappy with on a number of occasions this year - are the ones that really caused an uproar.\nWhen you're in the car, the emotions run high. Your brain is processing things at 200mph and all the energy and adrenalin means these things can bubble out. \nI've done it as well. I remember in one race I was complaining about something and my engineer came back and said: \"Allan, keep calm.\" The exact words Ferrari team boss Maurizio Arrivabene said to Vettel on Sunday. And I replied: \" I am ******* calm!\" Clearly, I wasn't.\nThe bizarre thing about it all is that Vettel was voted driver of the day by the fans, and I suspect it was at least as much to do with his outpouring of emotion as it was for his driving.\nSo, fine, warn Vettel about certain aspects of his behaviour. But the fans connect to the emotions and action involved, and F1 needs to be aware of that.\n", "tags": ["sport"], "abstract": "Nico Rosberg's one-race-at-a-time approach could backfire on him at the Brazilian Grand Prix as the mind games intensify.", "site": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/37861016", "title": "Lewis Hamilton's world title fortune could turn around at Brazilian GP"}, "128": {"text": "This has been the era where British sport has blessed its loyal followers like never before: fourth, third and second places in the Olympic medal table; the Tour de France yellow jersey won in four of the past five years; the miracle of a first male Wimbledon champion in 77 years, a marvel repeated three years on; the Davis Cup won for the first time since tennis was played in slacks and cable-knit jumpers.\nIt goes on. A first Olympic diving gold, a first Olympic gymnastics gold, and then a second, from the same man, a few hours later. Multiple Formula 1 world titles, Lions series won. The first woman in history to win an Olympic boxing gold, the first to retain one too.\nAnd now another bequest, from a man who has already provided so much. A British tennis player as world number one is an idea as ludicrous to recent memory as anything else in that giddy list, but with Andy Murray, we should no longer be surprised. \nTo a nation systematically unable to produce tennis champions despite finances and facilities at the elite level to embarrass others as well as itself, Murray is the gift that keeps giving.\nOnly 26 men have held that solitary ranking since the calculations went computerised 43 years ago. It is not a gimmick, or a marketing exercise, or even a reward in itself, but a defining benchmark. You cannot fluke it or get lucky with a judging panel. It is deserved. It is definitive.\n\"Being number one is the pinnacle of all the ambitions of every player,\" said Novak Djokovic, the man just deposed, when he began his own long reign three years ago. \"This is the dream.\"\nIt hasn't made every player happy. The only certain thing about being world number one is that the day will come when you will no longer be world number one.\nAndre Agassi has described how miserable it made him, how the achievement seemed to legitimise his father's cruel ambitions and obsessions rather than his own. John McEnroe, who spent a cumulative total of 170 weeks at the top of the pile, found it lonely atop the exposed summit.\n\"You're out there on your own island,\" he once said. \"And you feel like you're disengaged, not only with the rest of the world, but the rest of your competitors, some of them friends.\"\nClimbing the mountain is often an easier task in sport than defending your splendid isolation. \nThe England rugby union team who won the World Cup in 2003, having gone into that tournament as Grand Slam winners and on an unbeaten home run stretching back 22 games and four years, finished third in the subsequent Six Nations and fourth in the next two.\n\"In a game, thousands of decisions are being made, but it only needs a few to be the wrong ones for the team's fortunes to reverse,\" says Matt Dawson, scrum-half in that team. \"When it goes, it goes quickly.\"\nIt was the same for the England cricket team who rose to number one in the Test rankings after beating India in the summer of 2011: whitewashed in their next Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE, and then dismantled at home to South Africa the following summer, losing their captain Andrew Strauss and, for a while, their star batsman Kevin Pietersen.\nBeing world number one gets you respect. It also makes you a target. Everyone wants your scalp. Every defeat is automatically a headline.\nEven your own motivation can begin to slide, if only subconsciously, if only by minute fractions. How to focus on the next target when you can climb no further? Where can you go from the top but down?\nMurray's character may insulate him from those uncertainties for a while yet.  \nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\nThe 29-year-old's new position reflects both his own remarkable consistency over the past 12 months and the personal and physical problems that have shackled Djokovic, but it is also testament to a desire for self-improvement only occasionally found in sportsmen of his age.\nRanked 17th in the world a decade ago, he was gloriously log-jammed at four in those four seasons from 2008 to 2011, the unprecedented trio of Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal seeming to block any further ascent. \nHe dropped to sixth in 2014 after his back surgery and then appeared stymied at second for the past year as 12-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic went through the peak of his reign.\nThe belief and the hard work never dropped off. Different coaches, tweaked training, a renewed focus on the basics that, in this year alone, has seen his second serve refashioned and accelerated.\nIn defeat by Kei Nishikori in the US Open quarter-finals in September and Juan Martin del Potro in the Davis Cup semi-finals soon afterwards, he seemed physically spent - only to emerge revitalised in the past two months on this celebrated spree across first east Asia and now western Europe.\nAnd it is testament to self-belief too - that in an era decorated by three of the greatest players of all time, he could be crowned the best; that seven years and two months after first reaching number two, he could still take that final special step.\nPlenty of fine Grand Slam-winning players have never been world number one, Michael Chang, Goran Ivanisevic and Michael Stich among them. \nMany who have got there are arguably now in Murray's shadow: Pat Rafter, Carlos Moya, Marcelo Rios; definitely Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Thomas Muster; quite possibly Marat Safin and Andy Roddick, Ilie Nastase, Gustavo Kuerten and Lleyton Hewitt too.\nRankings in sport do not always reflect the accepted wisdom. Angelique Kerber may sit above Serena Williams in the women's tennis rankings, but with Williams having won five of their past six meetings and seven times as many career titles, the debate over who is the better player would be short. \nTriathlon's world rankings, based only on the year's World Series results, have Spain's Mario Mola as world number one, when every judge in the sport would define double Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee as the best in the world.\nFew could dispute Nick Faldo's claim to be the best golfer in the world when he topped golf's rankings. A few days after going to number one himself, Ian Woosnam would win the Masters. \nLuke Donald's ascension in 2011 was deserved - he was the first player in history to win the money title on both European and PGA tours in the same season - but because he had never finished as runner-up in a major, let alone won one, there were those who disputed the algorithm's accuracy. So too with Lee Westwood, number one in the same year, still to win a major five years on.\nThe number alone can be less important than the aura a player brings to it. After an unparalleled 12 months - that Davis Cup triumph, winning BBC Sports Personality for the second time, reaching his first French Open final, winning his second Wimbledon, taking Olympic singles gold yet again - Murray has that too.\nAnd this may yet be the start of something even more beautiful, rather than the pinnacle. \nAfter five defeats in the Australian Open final, never will Murray have a better chance of winning it than this January, Federer and Nadal faded, Djokovic - his nemesis in four of those finals - jaded. \nThe French Open title could conceivably be the next unprecedented prize to be pouched. And then Wimbledon again, and why not, after all that has been before?\nIt is dreamy, fanciful stuff.

Officials are confident in the technology, but there are weaknesses that have security professionals standing by on election day ready to step in if irregularities are spotted. \nThe task facing any hacker isn\u2019t insignificant. In the US, voting is done via electronic booths, the vast majority of which are not connected to the internet. \nFurthermore, different states, and areas within those states, use different systems - a logistical headache but something of a security godsend, as a fractured system is much harder to attack en masse. \nBut any would-be election hacker wouldn\u2019t need to target the whole country, or even an entire state. Instead, finding methods to implant minute differences, in areas which promise to be a close-run battle, could both affect the national picture and be difficult to detect. \nAnd so just as candidates target swing states that could go either way, so too could hackers be looking at \"hack states\" to target. \n\"Two out of the last four presidential elections were so close that a change of a few counties in one state would have changed the result of the national presidential election,\" said Andrew Appel, professor of computer science at Princeton University, in an interview with BBC News. \n\"It\u2019s not necessary to cheat in 9,000 different jurisdictions. If the election is close in just one state, changing several tens of thousands of votes might be enough.\" \nProf Appel is part of a team of cybersecurity experts that will be working together on Tuesday to advise election officials on cybersecurity-related matters - helping to identify genuine attacks from, say, just your bog-standard computer glitch, of which there may be plenty. \n\"There may be questions about some piece of machinery that is showing some symptom,\" he explained. \n\"Does that look like a hack or is that normal? That kind of question.\" \nAny security audit, whether it\u2019s to protect a company or a property, focuses on the points of weakness. And in this election, the points of weakness are the electronic voting booths. \nThe greatest concern of the group, which is mostly a mixture of academics and security professionals, is that the security in place on voting machines in some crucial areas just isn't up to scratch. \nFor starters, 10 states use touchscreen-only voting machines, an immediate concern.\n\"You touch the screen and indicate the candidate you want,\u201d explained Prof Appel. \n\"There\u2019s no paper involved, and at the end of the day it indicates how many votes the candidate got. There would be no way to tell if it was done fraudulently.\" \nSeveral security experts have demonstrated how this process can be tampered with, by installing malicious software capable of changing a switching a person's vote once it is in the machine, or by spoofing the smart cards used to identify a voter.\nOther states use what\u2019s known as optical scan voting. That\u2019s when a voter fills in a little oval on a page to cast their ballot. It\u2019s logged by the computer, to make counting much quicker, but also stored as a hard copy. If the computer says the vote goes a certain way and there\u2019s suspicion of shenanigans, it can be crossed checked against the paper copy. \nSo where are the \u201chack states\u201d? \nVerified Voting is an organisation that tracks the use of voting machines, and their security, across the US. It\u2019s a painstakingly put together dataset which gives you an idea of the complexity of the US voting system. \nBy using this resource, and combining it with polling data, Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman were able to isolate key states with both poor voting booth security and a tight race. \nThey named the states most at risk as Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Colorado. \n\"As jurisdictions with close races are most vulnerable to having their results perturbed or cast into doubt, these are the ones to be concerned about,\u201d the researchers wrote. \nMost experts are in agreement that the voting machines provide the biggest risk - the key under the mat for anyone looking for a way in. \nBut hackers may look to other means to agitate the process. \n\"A well resourced adversary, for instance a foreign government, could do plenty of other things to disrupt the election,\u201d wrote Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman. \n\"Cutting the power to a few key precincts could throw the entire election into chaos.\" \nFurthermore, Prof Appel pointed to previous incidents in which voter registration databases were breached.

ordering new trains; modifying or building new bridges; and changing various services.\nAmong the problems identified by the NAO were that by the time an overall plan was eventually devised last year:\nThe result, the NAO said, was that electrification alone would cost an extra \u00a3330m and the extent of that element should now be reconsidered.\nThe government auditor also said that the new trains would have to be reconfigured so that they could run under both electrical and diesel power.\nMeanwhile the Great Western franchise operator, FirstGroup, would have to bear much higher costs which, combined with less passenger revenue than expected, meant the government would earn less money than expected from the franchise.\nMr Morse added an optimistic note, saying: \"It is encouraging that since 2015 the department and Network Rail have a better grip and put in place structures to manage the programme in an integrated way.\" \n\"However, significant challenges to the timetable still remain and there is more to do to achieve value for money,\" he added. \nBut Meg Hillier MP, chair of the parliamentary committee of public accounts, was not impressed.\n\"The Department for Transport and Network Rails' failure to integrate crucial elements of the modernisation into one programme from the start has cost passengers and taxpayers' time and money,\" she said. \n\"I do not understand why it took the department two years from agreeing to buy new trains to produce a business case,\" she added.\n", "tags": ["business"], "abstract": "The government has been blamed for huge extra costs and lengthy delays to the modernisation of the Great Western railway network in England and Wales.", "site": "bbc", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37914853", "title": "Great Western rail modernisation costs rocket, says NAO"}, "137": {"text": "More than 370 jobs are at risk after the US drugs giant Pfizer announced plans to shut two of its UK sites.\nThe firm said its Hospira UK Ltd site at Park Royal, north London, was expected to shut by August next year.\nIts packaging and distribution site in Havant, Hampshire, is set for closure by the end of 2020.\nThe plans are part of an ongoing review of Pfizer's worldwide operations and are not related to the outcome of the EU Referendum, the firm said.\nPfizer proposes transferring work currently undertaken at its Havant facility - which employs more than 270 people - to its site in Puurs, Belgium.  \nThe Park Royal site - which has about 100 staff - is due to complete production in May next year, with a site exit in August.

He outlined plans to open 200 new Simply Food outlets. \nM&S refused to identify which 30 \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homewares and food \u2013 are to close or identify the 45 outlets that will be converted into food stores. The chain has 304 full-line stores and the closures and conversions will take five years to complete.\nThe retailer is also looking to relocate underperforming stores. Overall, the changes will mean a reduction of 10% in the floorspace devoted to racks of skirts, jumpers and trousers, with the plan expected to cost \u00a3150m over three years.\nThe turnaround plan outlined by Rowe also includes the closure of 53 loss-making overseas stores in 10 countries. They include 10 stores in China, seven in France and others in Belgium and Hungary, resulting in 2,100 job losses. Only company-owned stores in Ireland, Hong Kong and the Czech Republic will be spared.\nThe embattled retailer intends to put clothing and food on an equal footing with same amount of selling space devoted to both sides of the business. Currently two-thirds of its floor space is given over to racks of clothing and homewares. \nRowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&S\u2019s Croydon store in south London and took over as chief executive six months ago, insisted the decision to close stores and reduce the space given over to clothing was not an admission of defeat.\n\u201cThis is not about cutting jobs, it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019ve got the right estate for future shopping habits,\u201d he said. \nEarlier this year, he announced 500 job cuts at the group\u2019s head office in London and a plan to shift another 400 jobs out of the capital.\nThe M&S veteran is seeking to revive the fortunes of the 132-year-old retailer which has seen profits go backwards in recent years.

Hopkinson points to places such as Swindon and Stockton-on-Tees where shoppers have been drawn away from the high street by out-of-town retail parks.\nM&S has been battered by low-cost rivals such as H&M, Zara and Primark and shoppers are increasingly spending their spare cash on leisure activities, rather than buying new clothes. The turnaround plan was unveiled as the retailer reported a 19% fall in underlying profits to \u00a3231m in the six months to 1 October.\nTo win back shoppers, Rowe has already cut clothing prices and promised to pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers \u2013 fiftysomething women he has dubbed \u201cMrs M&S\u201d.

The Oxford-educated economics professor has won plaudits for his low-key efficacy, in sharp contrast to his forerunner, Yanis Varoufakis.\nStergios Pitsiorlas, a veteran leftist who helped found the ruling Syriza party, was elevated to the position of deputy economy minister. In his previous role as chairman of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency, Pitsiorlas had been praised for his no-nonsense approach to disposing of cash-draining state assets. The shipping minister, Theodoros Dritsas, who was against further investment in Piraeus port by the Chinese conglomerate Cosco was among those dropped, while Panos Skourletis, the energy and environment minister, who had vehemently opposed the partial privatisation of the Public Power Corporation, was moved to the interior ministry.\nSkourletis, an established Syriza figure, was described by insiders as too powerful to be removed altogether. He was replaced by George Stathakis who had held the economy ministry portfolio. \nThe septuagenarian leftist ideologue Aristides Baltas, who had been culture minister, was similarly replaced by Lydia Koniordou, Greece\u2019s foremost female classical actor. \nA new migration ministry was also established, reflecting the country\u2019s frontline role in the refugee crisis and allowing the deputy migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, to tap into resources and administrative backup in his promoted role as minister. \nThe popularity of Tsipras\u2019s two-party coalition has been in free-fall. A Public Issue poll last week put the government 24 percentage points behind the centre right New Democracy, the main opposition party. Tax increases and sustained cuts to wages and benefits have corroded its support with thousands of pensioners recently taking to the streets in protest in Athens.\nWith many of the measures beginning to bite this winter, the challenges remain immense for the country still seen as Europe\u2019s weakest link.

You know: spending the next month tutting whenever you hear Christmas music while becoming increasingly excited that Christmas is coming.\nThis year is particularly exciting as, for the first time, my partner and I are not spending it with either of our families but are instead staying at home. I haven\u2019t quite decided what to make for pudding yet, but I decided to get in the spirit by having a first attempt at Delia\u2019s Irish whiskey Christmas cakes.\nThis is a recipe that requires something of a run-up. In order to get the flavours right, it must be stored in the fridge for seven days, where the mixture of whiskey, Angostura bitters, raisins, currants and almonds has to be given time to mature along with your growing irritation at the large box now taking up space in your fridge to house this delicious cake.\nAt least, that\u2019s the theory. I ran into a few problems with this recipe \u2013 not least that the first time around the lag between making a hash of the recipe, and then discovering this, made it difficult to remember what, exactly, I had done wrong. I advise taking notes on the first couple of run-throughs.\nDelia\u2019s recipe uses nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. My advice is to buy the right amounts fresh to make this cake, unless you prefer the prospect of Stephen\u2019s Overwhelming Clove and Whiskey cake to Delia\u2019s mellower, authentic version.\nMy second difficulty came with the whiskey itself. I\u2019ve always wanted to persuade myself to like whiskey, as it always looks terribly sophisticated in movies, but I have yet to succeed \u2013 other than in cakes, where I like it a great deal.\nAs I didn\u2019t much fancy shelling out for a particularly high-quality bottle of the stuff, I went low-budget. (I\u2019m ashamed to admit that my preparation for this recipe consisted of googling \u201ccheap Irish whiskey\u201d and buying a bottle for a tenner.)\nI found that the resulting cake still tasted a little too strongly of whiskey \u2013 and cloves of course. It tasted like someone\u2019s mouth after an evening of cheap booze and mince pies \u2013 so if you\u2019ve ever had an ill-advised hookup at a Christmas party, and wanted to recreate the experience in cake form, I have an excellent recipe for you.\nMy advice is to slightly under-dose on the whiskey in Delia\u2019s recipe, who I imagine went for a rather better bottle than I did. That, or buy better whiskey.\nThe finished product is meant to look like an elegantly wrapped parcel, which \u2013 if you remove the word \u201celegantly\u201d \u2013 mine does.\nThe finished product a la Delia looks like the presents you buy that are gift-wrapped in-store. My finished product looks like a present wrapped by an enthusiastic child \u2013 very possibly a child who has been helping themselves to the whiskey.\nTo hold it all together, Delia uses marzipan as a joining agent. I am aware that marzipan is a divisive foodstuff \u2013 some people think it\u2019s disgusting \u2013 and I am happy to report that there are three ways around this.\nThe first is to make more of the apricot jam and whiskey mixture and use that to hold it together. The second is to use regular icing.\nThe third \u2013 and my preferred option \u2013 is to turn the page to Delia\u2019s recipe for Irish tea bread, which I made out of curiosity while waiting for the cake mixture to mature. It\u2019s simple, delicious \u2013 and to me, really tastes like Christmas.\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "The Delia project: It\u2019s time to think festive ... but do a few dry runs before making this boozy\u00a0bake for real", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/04/delia-smith-christmas-cake-recipe-stephen-bush-delia-project", "title": "Delia\u2019s Christmas cake recipe takes a little bit of practice | The Delia project"}, "146": {"text": "One in seven people around the world suffer from migraine. In the UK, migraine has a crippling economic effect, with approximately 25m days lost every year, costing the country \u00a32.3bn. But while the condition has been studied since the time of the ancient Greeks \u2013 who attempted to treat it with trepanning, by drilling a hole into the skull to release evil spirits \u2013 it remains poorly understood with few adequate treatments.\nMigraine is an inherited disorder characterised by episodes of throbbing head pain. Many patients also report nausea, sensory hyperactivity, with ordinary volumes of sound or light seeming intolerably loud or bright. Others experience aura or neurological abnormalities such as vertigo, temporary blindness and numbness. Some rare types, such as hemiplegic migraine, are single gene disorders, with a particular mutation predisposing individuals to neuronal hyperactivity, meaning that areas of the brain involved in interpreting sensory events can be easily activated. But most common forms are polygenic \u2013 in which a constellation of genes contribute. Various environmental triggers are also strongly associated with migraine, including stress, skipping meals and lack of adequate sleep.\nOur understanding of the neurological processes is still limited, but scientists are starting to put some of the pieces together. \u201cWe know that dilation of blood vessels may play a role and some of the newer treatments try to inhibit this,\u201d says Elizabeth Loder, professor of neurology at Harvard medical school.\nSerious research into migraine began only relatively recently, as for a long time many doctors believed that it was a psychosomatic condition produced by people being unable to deal with stress. \u201cIt was a disorder that most obviously affected women and so wasn\u2019t taken as seriously,\u201d Loder says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a pain disorder. Pain is subjective: we don\u2019t have any way of measuring it, which can make it very hard for people to believe it\u2019s real. Plus, on top of all of that, it\u2019s episodic, so between attacks, sufferers may look perfectly well.\u201d\nThe fact that migraine is researched at all owes a lot to the development of the medication methysergide in 1960, which was found to eliminate headaches in weeks. The drug is no longer commercially available as it was found to have serious side-effects, but its legacy remains. What had been perceived as a psychological condition clearly had a biological basis. \u201cThe market is, of course, very big,\u201d Loder says. \u201cIt\u2019s a common disorder, it lasts decades. So, that made pharmaceutical companies sit up and take notice; money poured into the field; it improved and professionalised research.\u201d\nHowever, migraine receives much less funding, compared with similarly debilitating conditions. Studies looking at money allocated by the US National Institute of Health, for example, have shown that migraine is considerably underfunded.\nMigraine is extremely common in both sexes but statistics suggest that it is more prevalent in women. Reports in the US estimate that, while 12% of the population has had an attack in the past year, this rises to 18% when women alone are considered.\nScientists suspect that cycling ovarian steroid hormones, in particular the drop in oestrogen that occurs during the menstrual cycle, are particularly provocative, especially for those genetically susceptible to the disorder. The dissipation of these hormones with age explains why some women find that migraine attacks become less common as they get older.\n\u201cI think women with the disorder are more likely than men to be accurately diagnosed with migraine,\u201d Loder says. \u201cWomen see doctors more and are less likely to be hesitant to complain about head pain than men are. Some research shows that men with the disorder tend to be investigated for other causes of headache, suggesting that doctors have a cognitive bias and they don\u2019t think of migraine as readily as they do with women.\u201d\nThe disorder is most active and troublesome during the middle years of life, when people would otherwise be at their most productive, and typically don\u2019t have as many competing causes of disability. But as you get older, the effects usually seem to diminish.\n\u201cClinically it\u2019s extremely unusual to see people in their 60s, 70s and older saying that their migraines are just as bad as they have always been,\u201d Loder says. \u201cIt does happen, but it\u2019s so uncommon that everybody sits up and takes note.\u201d\n It is thought that some of the processes that produce a severe migraine cannot happen as efficiently in older people. As we age, our arteries become stiffer and some of the vascular events that cause migraine can\u2019t happen as easily.\nA class of medications called triptans are typically prescribed. However, about 30-40% of migraine patients don\u2019t respond to the first triptan prescribed, and, for those who don\u2019t respond at all, there are few alternatives \u2013 no new migraine drugs have been developed since the early 90s. In addition, pain relief from triptans is relatively slow \u2013 they often take 45-90 minutes to take effect.\nFor chronic migraine sufferers \u2013 those who experience headaches on more than 15 days a month \u2013 the effectiveness of treatment is particularly poor, with many medications causing side-effects such as sedation, dizziness and mood change.\n\u201cThe problem is that a number of the drugs currently prescribed weren\u2019t originally developed for migraine,\u201d says Brendan Davies, consultant neurologist at University Hospitals of North Midlands and a trustee of the Migraine Trust. \u201cThey were initially developed for epilepsy or depression, before they were found to be potentially beneficial for migraine, and so they work on pathways in the brain which may not be migraine specific.\u201d\nTriptans are referred to as \u201cabortive medicines\u201d, as they treat an individual migraine attack, but drug companies are looking at injections that could prevent migraines from starting. Levels of one particular protein, CGRP, a very powerful vasodilating substance, have been found to shoot up during migraine attacks. Another protein, PACAP, is also thought to be a promising new drug target. So far, the companies have invested heavily in developing antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block them. These are typically administered via monthly injections, rather than daily tablets. \u201cSo far, the results of all the published studies suggest that these treatments do work better than placebo,\u201d Loder says. \u201cThey don\u2019t completely eliminate headaches, but they reduce their frequency. In one recent study of a group who had, on average, 18 headache days a month, people who took the drug had an average reduction of 6.6 days compared with 4.2 days in those who took a placebo. The difference between drug and placebo is modest but there is an effect.\u201d\nHowever, so far only half of migraine sufferers appear to respond to CGRP antibodies, and there is no way of predicting who will benefit. In addition, little is known of the long-term consequences of blocking CGRP. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d Loder says. \u201cFirst, these treatments are likely to be very costly, and second, CGRP is very widely distributed through the body, and there\u2019s some suggestion from animal studies that there could be long-term side-effects. They could turn out to be safe medications, but we\u2019re speculating. If you think about antibodies which have been developed for common neurologic illnesses such as MS, there have been long-term safety concerns.\u201d\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "Are women more prone to them?

Recent headlines have focused on the negative aspects of traditional hormonal birth control: the pill causes depression and gender mutation in freshwater fish, while a clinical trial for a male contraceptive jab was abandoned when the subjects began suffering side-effects already well-known to women.\nBut 50 years since it first became available, the pill remains the default option, and women still shoulder the responsibility for preventing pregnancies. Could software be the solution? Elina Berglund Scherwitzl, founder and chief technical officer of mobile fertility app Natural Cycles thinks so.\nUsing a sensitive thermometer and sophisticated mathematics, Natural Cycles is an old-fashioned period tracker, with extra features. The app, which launched in 2014, asks users to take their temperatures in the morning, preferably before getting out of bed, then input that into the app, which tells them where they are in their menstrual cycle. Days when a woman can get pregnant become red; \u201csafe\u201d days are green. So far, so low-tech. What makes Natural Cycles unique, though, is the algorithm developed by Berglund.\nThe 32-year-old from Malm\u00f6 in Sweden holds a PhD in particle physics and was a member of the team that discovered the Higgs boson at Cern, before developing her life-changing formula.\nThrough daily use, the algorithm learns not just how to map an individual\u2019s ovulation but to predict it, too. That allows the five days prior to ovulation to be identified in real time, alerting women to the fact that male sperm can linger for that long in their bodies, ready to pounce on an egg when it is released.\nThe app fills a gap in the market, spotted by Berglund when she felt fed up with the limited options on offer other than hormonal contraception. She devised the algorithm and started mapping her own cycle, as well as those of female colleagues at Cern. It proved so succesful that Berglund and her husband, fellow physicist and Natural Cycle\u2019s CEO Raoul Scherwitzl, decided to devote more time to the app.\nBerglund has hired a team of researchers that includes Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor in obstetrics and gynaecology at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. Their most recently published clinical study showed that Natural Cycles, when used correctly, is as efficient in preventing pregnancies as the pill. Unlike the pill, though, it doesn\u2019t offer any cover for fertile days, which means that comparing the app to medical contraception can be tricky.\nAsking women to put faith in their phones to protect them from getting pregnant is a complicated business. In Sweden, the app was criticised for targeting young lifestyle bloggers and their impressionable readers. One example was Blondinbella, by Isabella L\u00f6wengrip, who is now a Natural Cycles investor. (L\u00f6wengrip says that the average age of her 1.3 million weekly readers is just over 30 \u2013 two years older than the typical Natural Cycles subscriber.) In December last year, the Swedish Medical Products Agency also banned the app from calling itself a preventivmedel \u2013 the Swedish word for \u201ccontraception\u201d, which is associated with purely medical birth control. As a result, it\u2019s now marketed as a \u201cfertility monitoring device\u201d that \u201ccan be used to avoid pregnancies\u201d. Berglund doesn\u2019t seem too worried, though.\n\u201cWhat we do is track fertility, right? And then women can use it how they want \u2013 it\u2019s a tool for them to use this information either to prevent or plan a pregnancy.\u201d Plus, she says, the company\u2019s research shows that younger women are more disciplined in using contraception on red days; their pregnancy rates were much lower than those of users above the age of 35.\nThe ideal app user, Berglund says, is a woman in a stable relationship who is planning to have children at some point, and who would like a break from hormonal contraception ahead of trying. Gemzell Danielsson points out that it\u2019s not a good option for women who absolutely want to avoid a pregnancy. Nor does she recommend it for anyone who has what she describes as \u201can irregular lifestyle\u201d, irregular menstrual cycles or lacks the motivation to stay on top of their cycles. The latter of these categories might account for the 45% drop-out rate that the app is currently experiencing; women who sign up but fail to keep to their thermometer schedule.\nThe most important thing about Natural Cycles, Berglund and Gemzell Danielsson argue, is that it adds an alternative method to the mix. \u201cI\u2019m still surprised that there hasn\u2019t been such a product before,\u201d Berglund says. \u201cI have been thinking about this since I was a teenager, because I didn\u2019t feel well from taking the pill.\u201d\nBerglund is critical of the conveyor-belt style in which young women are prescribed it, and the fact that birth control is still very one-sided within relationships. \u201cSweden is supposed to be the most gender-equal country, but I think when it comes to contraception \u2026 the burden is very much on the woman.\u201d Natural Cycles, she insists, is \u201cmore of a couple\u2019s thing \u2013 the woman measures her temperature and the man sometimes has to wear a condom.\u201d \u201d\nThe most important thing for the company, Berglund says, is to gain trust. \u201cThat\u2019s why we keep performing clinical studies and why we try to achieve a higher ISO class of medical device status.\u201d\nBut before Natural Cycles can become as trustworthy a contraceptive option as hormonal methods, larger-scale, independent studies will need to prove its efficacy. So while the app hasn\u2019t killed the pill just yet, it is a welcome addition.\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "Cern scientist Elina Berglund developed an app to monitor her own fertility, with impressive results.

Or to be more precise, Josh\u2019s film is about what he feels about the pregnancy: because it\u2019s hard work, this pregnancy lark, for Josh. While Devorah is hoping against hope that, after three years of fertility treatment, the couple really are going to become parents, Josh is doing the really difficult bit of pregnancy: he\u2019s having a full-on, no-holds-barred existential crisis. On camera.\nHow is it for a man in the 21st century when his partner is pregnant? History has changed everything: Stone Age Josh would have gone out hunter-gathering, prepared a safe nest, fought off intruders and brought back food. Modern-day Josh is sitting in his kitchen while his wife and her girlfriends shriek with delight at news of the conception; and then the further bit of news, which is that there are in fact two heartbeats, not one. He is looking very, very scared. What does pregnancy mean for a man in the 21st century? Josh isn\u2019t the main earner. Devorah is the one with a job; Josh is the freelance, and right now he\u2019s the freelance with no work. These were, in fact, the circumstances that led to the project. \u201cJosh thought he was going to make a romcom in Italy,\u201d says Devorah, when we meet at their house in west London. \u201cAnd he said, if it falls through I\u2019ll just have to make a film about us. And suddenly it did fall through, and there he was making this film about us.\u201d\nThe result is The New Man \u2013 executive produced by David Baddiel whose 2010 film Infidel Josh directed \u2013 which opens in cinemas from 21 November. In the film, Devorah humours Josh, telling her friends she\u2019s agreed to be filmed because it\u2019s good for her husband, that making this film is giving him the space to explore his worries and anxieties about impending parenthood. Josh canvasses his male friends who are already fathers, naming those deep-seated concerns that all dads-to-be have, but few articulate (and certainly not on film). \u201cDid you feel you were being usurped? Or fear being usurped \u2026 that you were redundant, you didn\u2019t have a role? That\u2019s it: you gave the sperm, now Mummy has her little boy? Oedipal complex?\u201d\nHis friends are mumbling something that sounds like \u201cNo, no\u201d; but Josh has opened his floodgates, and the fears keep hurtling out. \u201cThere\u2019s not [going to be] enough time for me, there\u2019s not [going to be] enough love. I\u2019m someone who needs endless affection and attention and then suddenly there\u2019s this kid who needs it more than I do \u2026\u201d\nThrough most of the first half of the film, Josh looks like he\u2019s stumbled into the wrong movie. Unkempt, ramshackle, sitting around in his boxer shorts and socks, alternately pouring out his angst and ostentatiously internalising it, his grim distraction is a constant foil to the glowing Devorah\u2019s keeping-a-lid-on-it excitement as the weeks go by, and it seems more and more likely that the couple really are going to have two babies.\nAnd then, everything changes.\nIt\u2019s the 20-week scan, but true to his complex form, Josh has decided to absent himself and have a holiday in Spain with a friend. When he talked to Devorah initially she was fine with it; her mum has gone along to the hospital with her, and they\u2019re going to call him as soon as it\u2019s all over and they know the sexes of the babies, and that everything is OK. So we have Josh sitting beside an idyllic harbour in his shorts, and we have Devorah\u2019s mum phoning from the clinic with updates on how things are going. And even before the bad news, we have the sense that the increasingly agitated Josh has realised that this really isn\u2019t OK, that he should be with Devorah, that he\u2019s let her down by being away on holiday when she\u2019s negotiating such a big hurdle in the pregnancy on her own. \u201cFuck,\u201d he says, as the sun glistens on the water behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful.\u201d\nAnd that is more or less the last moment in the film when it\u2019s all about Josh: because while he\u2019s on a Spanish balcony, Devorah is in a London hospital being told that one of their twin boys has a genetic abnormality and will not survive. Worse, she must carry his body through to delivery, so her womb will be a coffin as well as an incubator. And, even worse still, the dead twin may precipitate labour, in which case the unaffected twin may not make it, either.\nJosh doesn\u2019t say \u201cfuck\u201d so much after that, but now he\u2019d be entirely entitled to say that, and more often. The earth has shifted and his self-absorbed philosophical crisis has become a tragic, practical crisis in real time. And dreadful though it is, the appalling turn of events has given him his role: he must support Devorah, and he must reassure her, and keep on reassuring her, that all will be well. When a friend jokes, \u201cHow\u2019s your sex life?\u201d, Josh dismisses the question as no longer of real relevance. \u201cNo sex,\u201d he says quietly, and without any angst at all.\nAt this point, Josh explains when we meet, the film went from being an arty cri de coeur to being his prop as his world slowly crumbled around him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t coping,\u201d he admits. \u201cSometimes all I could do was turn the camera on.\u201d The movie kept him going, and he helped Devorah keep going. \u201cWe went from doing something that\u2019s so normal and ordinary \u2013 having a baby \u2013 to something that\u2019s really unusual and far less common, which is losing a baby \u2026\u201d And the circumstances of the loss were particularly confusing. \u201cThere was this clash of life narratives,\u201d says Josh. \u201cBirth is supposed to be this wonderful thing, a miracle, a time for celebration. But for us it was also about grief and loss. It was weird. We didn\u2019t know which way to go.\u201d\nThe Josh of today seems more grown up than the Josh of the film. He\u2019s still running his fingers through his curls, but the little-boy-lost look has gone. Because he\u2019s now a dad; a father of two. Manny, the twin who survived the pregnancy, is two and a half, and a surprise natural pregnancy followed quickly, so he has a seven-month-old brother, Isaiah. But it\u2019s not only the hurly-burly of family life that\u2019s changed Josh: something else altered him, something awful and deeply poignant, something we see at close quarters in his film. Because while Devorah and Manny were still in hospital, recovering from the birth, Josh had to take the tiny coffin containing Manny\u2019s twin, Ben, to a graveyard. He is seen beside the undertaker, heaping soil on to the small box, doing the most unnatural thing any of us is ever called to do on this earth: saying goodbye to a child who has predeceased us.\nAt screenings of the film they attend, Devorah and Josh always leave halfway through, before the section about the 20-week scan and loss of Ben. \u201cWhy would you put yourself through all that?\u201d asks Devorah. \u201cIt brings it all back \u2013 what\u2019s the point?\u201d Ben will always be in their hearts, but life with Manny and Isaiah is to the fore in their lives now.\nBut what about all Josh\u2019s fears? There are two new men in Devorah\u2019s life now, after all \u2013 so how is he coping? Well, he says, no question: he was right all along. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot less time for me. Fewer cuddles, less sex. All the things I worried about in the film are true. But what I couldn\u2019t have predicted was how it feels to have children. The love affair between me and my sons is overwhelming \u2013 and that\u2019s the part I couldn\u2019t have anticipated. That\u2019s the bit I couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d\n\u2022 The New Man is released on 21 November\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "About to become a father for the first time, film director Josh Appignanesi turned the camera on himself and his pregnant wife.

It is 2004, and the child is easy to picture. Her parents have photographed their daughter\u2019s first breath, first smile, first spoonfuls and first steps. When she reaches school age, she is snapped in uniform, probably outside the front door, and one parent, probably her mother, shares the image with friends. The child learns to read, write her name. She wins certificates, excels at sport. When Twitter, Instagram and later Vine arrive, her public identities multiply. She starts secondary school.\nIn a few months, this child and her classmates will begin to turn 13 and, perhaps, create their own Facebook accounts. When they do, they will come face to face with their digital shadow. They may step into it easily, or try to sever themselves from it, but it won\u2019t let go, this pre-existent media identity, because it has logged their lives from the moment they left the womb. Some will recognise their digital shadow, but what of those whose online identity bears little relation to their sense of self, or to the public identity they want to share? For years, parents have fretted about their children\u2019s posting activities, while continuing to post as they wish about their offspring. Is it time they stopped \u2013 or at least asked for permission first?\nToday these questions are on the minds of the children at Kingsford community school in Beckton, east London, where the 13-, 14- and 15-year-old members of the Debate Mate after-school club are filing into a classroom on the first floor, slinging down school bags and glancing at the motion on the whiteboard. \u201cThis house would ban parents from posting about their children on social media,\u201d the debate leader writes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird your parents are still posting pictures of you on social media,\u201d someone says. One boy, Malachi, bows his head and writes a single word on his notepad: reputation. \u201cThis is really about consent,\u201d his friend says. \u201cDo I want to be seen by a larger, broader range of people?\u201d There is a loud hum of agreement and one girl raises her voice: \u201cParents! We don\u2019t want them invading our privacy. Because some of us, the only privacy we get is through social media.\u201d\nThese pupils often discuss social networking sites, their attractions and perils, but this is the first time they have turned their scrutiny on their own parents. And yet parents are the object of an increasingly aggressive interrogation. This spring a mother from Shropshire called out her son\u2019s bullying on Facebook, only for the post to go viral; the criticism of her became so intense she removed it and changed her Facebook page and phone number. Next came the 20-year-old mother from Balloch, Scotland, whose photographs of her 11-month-old daughter in tiny high fashion outfits attracted an Instagram following that included Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian \u2013 until critics claimed the woman was sexualising her baby. She has since locked the account and gone to ground. After her came the Arizona father who nakedly cradled his naked, feverish baby in the shower, an image his wife snapped and shared, before Facebook removed it as offensive.\nExcessive sharing about your children has long incited disapproval, but recently the disapproval has begun to acquire a proto-legal tinge. In March, French police warned parents against posting photos of their children on social media; according to social media analyst Eric Delcroix, the children could soon be able to sue them for posting inappropriate pictures, under the country\u2019s privacy laws. The treasurer of the UK\u2019s Human Rights Lawyers Association, Leanne Targett-Parker, echoes the idea that it is only a matter of time before children mount legal challenges against oversharing parents. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine it not being something that starts to develop within the next five to 10 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how there can\u2019t be attempts at suing people for putting up posts that they\u2019re unhappy with.\u201d\nSome parents may shrug off the shaming stories \u2013 and the professionalised sharing of family vloggers such as the Shaytards, the Brataleys, the Ballingers \u2013 as beyond the range of their own moderate social media activity. But listen to the children in the Kingsford classroom and it becomes clear how many degrees there are of shame. To these teenagers, even small instances of sharing can be divisive. When I ask if anyone has experienced being overshared themselves, hands shoot up, but the answers are a long way from the public shaming that normally grabs headlines. They are exactly the sort of infringements that many parents will commit without a second thought.\n\u201cI was eating a Subway. Chicken teriyaki. Eating that and my mum just took the picture and posted it on Facebook,\u201d one pupil says.\n\u201cWhen I was little my parents took a picture of me being potty-trained. Three weeks ago they posted it on Facebook. Me on the toilet. It was really embarrassing,\u201d another adds.\n\u201cI was with my aunt in the park. I was wearing my scarf but I didn\u2019t have a pin. It flew off and my hair was all raggedy, sticking up all over the place. My auntie put it on Facebook. I was so embarrassed I was crying. I asked her to take it down but she said, \u2018No, it looks cute.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMy uncle posted when his daughter had diarrhoea: \u2018Pray for her.\u2019\u201d\nOne girl, 14, raises her hand. \u201cParents love to post things about you, personal information that you might not like,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich kind of affects your relationship with them. Now, when you want to speak to them about certain things, you\u2019re worried they might post it.\u201d\nHer classmate Erin stands up. Her team supports the motion on the whiteboard \u2013 that parents should be banned from posting \u2013 and they have an idea. \u201cWe want to pass a law that requires open forms of social media to put a consent button on their pages, so a child can report whether their parents have posted about them without consent,\u201d she declares. \u201cIf parents refuse to cooperate, they will be fined the amount of \u00a31,000.\u201d\nThese suggestions may sound excessive and unfeasible; in fact they lie squarely within the recommendations made by a number of adults campaigning in this field. Erin\u2019s idea of a penalty, for instance, echoes the attempts by a Democratic state representative in Illinois, La Shawn K Ford, to make the shaming of children on social networking sites an offence. Offending parents should face a penalty, he has argued, which, just like Erin\u2019s, would be a fine paid directly to the child. As for the apparently far-fetched idea of a \u201cconsent button\u201d, this sounds uncannily similar to the \u201cdelete button\u201d proposed by 5Rights, the campaign steered by the peer and film-maker Beeban Kidron to protect and empower children online.\nMore generally, the debaters\u2019 irritation chimes with research published in March by a team at the University of Michigan. After interviewing 249 parent-children pairings across 40 US states, the researchers found that children were more than twice as likely as parents to say that adults should not post information online about them without permission. Would the Kingsford children concur? Class E11 rings with shouts of, \u201cYes!\u201d\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen,\u201d their teacher, Miss Alimi, says.\n\u201cMiss!\u201d one of her students cries. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing called wishful thinking.\u201d\n***\nMiss Alimi is right: children are unlikely to gain control over their parents\u2019 posting habits. But there is still scope for a conversation about what constitutes fair sharing, and each family will draw its lines differently. Consider the case of Heather Whitten, the Arizona-based photographer and teaching assistant who took the photograph of her husband and son in the shower that Facebook didn\u2019t like. Whitten saw the moment, and the image, as the height of parental care. Their toddler, Fox, had had a temperature for hours. Her husband, Thomas, was trying to cool the child\u2019s fever. For two years, Whitten kept the image private, finally posting it in May after Facebook removed other pictures she had shared of her children. She wanted to take a stand, \u201cto show that it\u2019s just innocent pictures that people are twisting and getting offended by\u201d.\nShe was unprepared for the response \u2013 for the way in which Facebook removed images from her page every time it received sufficient complaints, for the level of disapproval the image provoked, including claims that it was \u201csexual\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d. But Whitten\u2019s stand had one other unexpected consequence. As the interested and the outraged followed the link to her blog, some began to question the legality, as well as the sense, of showing children naked. \u201cI just thought you were free to post what you wanted on the internet,\u201d Whitten says now. But then she discovered that in the state of Arizona, \u201cyou can\u2019t show any naked images of children\u2019s pelvic area or butt, and I realised I was technically breaking a law.\u201d\nShe removed the blog \u2013 \u201ctook everything down\u201d \u2013 but \u201cin the bigger, moral sense, I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve done anything wrong. I\u2019m not exploiting my children. I\u2019m not abusing my children. I\u2019m just sharing our lives exactly how they are.\u201d\nWhitten\u2019s experience shows just how nebulous and fraught the territory of sharing can be. Sure, her experience would never befall those for whom posting naked images of children is strictly out of bounds. But the case of Whitten is complicated. She and her partner are raising their children \u201cto not be ashamed or embarrassed of their bodies\u201d. They are living online within the offline boundaries they have set for themselves. \u201cPeople don\u2019t show nudity a lot of times because they think it will have a negative impact on their child. Your footprint is for ever on the internet,\u201d Whitten says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s absurd. I just hope to combat that a little. Who knows how it will actually turn out, but I hope that my children won\u2019t ever look back and see pictures of themselves as children and feel embarrassed by other people seeing them as well. Because there is nothing to be embarrassed about.\u201d\nFox, the toddler in the shower, is still too young to veto or cherish the photograph that caused such controversy, but his older sister Lily, nine, \u201cloves it\u201d, according to her mother. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t really wrap her head around why people would think there was anything wrong with it.\u201d\nAnd yet, while Lily was comfortable with the image of her baby brother, she was deeply unhappy with other photographs her mother had uploaded \u2013 the apparently harmless kind that many parents post. One day at around the age of six, Lily began to scroll through her mother\u2019s Instagram. \u201cShe saw how many pictures there were of her and she didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Whitten says. For months, whenever Lily saw Whitten with the camera, she hid. \u201cThat really opened up a conversation about why I take pictures, why I share pictures, who I share pictures with.\u201d Now, Whitten says, \u201cany time you see Lily, it is with her permission\u201d.\nAlicia Blum-Ross, a researcher at the London School of Economics, believes we are entering a crucial moment. \u201cWe are starting to see kids who have grown up, whose parents have shared images, and who are beginning to say: \u2018Wait a minute. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable with that.\u2019\u201d What families need, she thinks, is a coming-of-age conversation. After all, it was Lily Whitten herself, at six, who instigated the dialogue with her mother that earned her the right to veto content. Does Lily have advice for other children? \u201cThey should say, \u2018Please don\u2019t take any pictures of me \u2013 it makes me uncomfortable,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd \u2018I might change my mind one day, but today I don\u2019t want to have to hide from your camera.\u2019\u201d Soon this \u201cdigital rulebook\u201d chat might become as standard as the one about the birds and the bees. Blum-Ross sees nothing to fear. Both parties, she points out, are united by being the first generation \u2013 of parents and children \u2013 to negotiate this path. \u201cIt can be a really shared experience,\u201d she says enthusiastically. \u201cThe dilemmas are shared dilemmas, the pleasures are shared pleasures. It\u2019s a moment of overlap.\u201d\nBlum-Ross, who has three-year-old twins, says she is \u201cnot a person who advises total protection. I certainly wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t share things about your children online.\u2019 It\u2019s important that parents are able to claim their own space about that. It\u2019s OK to say, \u2018I need this community.\u2019\u201d Whitten, too, has always seen her sharing in those terms: \u201cI feel I share everything as my story \u2013 this is my perspective on my life as a mother with these children. I\u2019m not trying to put words in their mouth, or tell the story from their perspective.\u201d\nIt is one of the oldest questions of storytelling: who does the story belong to? Blum-Ross, Whitten and countless others believe they are telling their own stories, and sharing posts about their children where they fit that perspective. But it\u2019s complicated. \u201cI never had a filter before,\u201d says Whitten, sounding forlorn. \u201cI love the idea of having connections with other mothers and people. But I can\u2019t share the way I used to.\u201d After the Facebook furore, she is still fathoming whether to photograph differently or simply stop sharing.\nFor other parents, such as the author Amy Webb, who has written about her commitment to post nothing about her daughter online, the same process of consideration deters them from sharing altogether. They have the big conversation \u2013 with themselves, each other, sometimes their children \u2013 and decide the best answer is silence.\nWhen the Guardian asked readers about their experiences, Apricot, who is 30 and lives in the north of England, wrote: \u201cWhen I started to Facebook my own child\u2019s pictures, I began to feel intensely uncomfortable. How could I instil in her a principle of privacy when I had essentially devalued hers from the beginning?\u201d She stopped posting. \u201cWhat we post is facets of ourselves,\u201d said Tamasine Preece, a teacher in Bridgend, whose PhD includes a chapter on oversharing. \u201cI think there is a morality to using children to explore parts of ourselves. My children are not me. They are separate.\u201d\nKidron, who says she has never interacted with her children on social networking sites (they are now 19 and 21), thinks that her behaviour reflects the idea that \u201coversharing is inappropriate when the whole point of the journey to adulthood is to self-define \u2013 to work out who you are, what your values are, how you\u2019re going to fit in. I think we have not thought hard enough about what that process might be like, if so much is shared and so much is public.\n\u201cThere are three issues here,\u201d she says. \u201cOne is the right to a certain sort of privacy. The second is the need of young people to transgress and bump into their edges, and for that to be somewhat safe. The third is the need to break away from the model of your parents.\u201d\nMy own Facebook posts dried up as I researched this article. Of course, I can ask my children for consent, but I am not sure they are ready for a responsibility with permanent consequences. If an eight-year-old consents to a post, is it fair to act upon that consent, or should a parent second-guess how those feelings might evolve? After all, posts are eternal and a child cannot speak for his or her future self.\nIn any case, a child\u2019s consent can be capricious, even within one given day. My daughter, at eight, would prefer her photo not to appear on Facebook, but would be more than happy to see a video of herself playing Swingball on YouTube. My six-year-old, meanwhile, says he is sad that \u201cGoogle doesn\u2019t know me\u201d. Even the teenagers at Kingsford are conflicted. In the end, they vote against Erin\u2019s suggestion of a fine for parents who share without their children\u2019s consent, but they squirm in their seats, clawing the air for a turn to speak when I ask what rules they would lay down for their parents:\n\u201cDon\u2019t say embarrassing jokes \u2019cos that\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as the world is concerned, we\u2019re not related.\u201d\n\u201cPost pictures of me when I look amazing.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t post baby pictures unless I\u2019m happy and fully clothed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever comment on my pictures.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t stalk my profile waiting for me to load pictures.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t follow.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t add me. Or my friends.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell dad jokes.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take pictures of me eating food, \u2019cos my friends take it out of context.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and use internet slang on our wall. On your friends\u2019 profiles you can embarrass yourselves all you want, but when it\u2019s on our profiles it looks like we\u2019ve taught you to say that. And it makes us look really bad.\u201d\n\u201cStay behind the times.\u201d\n***\nOf course, every family is different. In a quiet cul-de-sac in Newton Abbot, Devon, with sunlight pouring into the lounge, Molly Povey and her 11-year-old son Roman are sitting on the sofa discussing their experience of going viral.\nIn April 2015, with Roman desperately unhappy at school, Molly posted a plea on her Facebook page for his classmates\u2019 parents to send her \u201cbeautiful son\u201d birthday cards. \u201cRoman doesn\u2019t have any friends and often cries himself to sleep,\u201d the post began. It was shared around the world. \u201cMaybe 40,000 times,\u201d Molly says. (Interestingly, her post breaks only the second of the Kingsford rules, by disclosing that Molly and Roman are related.)\nNeither Molly nor Roman, nor his two brothers, nor his dad Ian, who says he hates social media, were prepared for what happened next. Thousands of people left birthday greetings online. At the office of a friend \u2013 whose address was hastily borrowed to protect Roman\u2019s privacy \u2013 cards and gifts began to arrive. Molly formalised the chaos into a Cards For Roman Facebook page.\nFriendships were made, and some of them have lasted \u2013 to the extent that in April, a year after his mother\u2019s plea for help, Roman celebrated his 12th birthday with 150 friends, strangers and Facebook friends at a Nando\u2019s in Exeter and at a second party in London. They have even met up with well-wishers in Germany.\nWhile Molly tells this story, talking quickly because there is a lot to fit in, Roman scurries to and fro with his gifts: a Star Wars chess set from someone in the Netherlands, pictures from Brazilian schoolchildren (Molly says he is very big in Brazil), wicker baskets of cards.\nBut sometimes Molly worries. \u201cA bit. I think, what happens in years to come if he Googles himself and finds \u2018Lonely boy with no friends\u2019?\u201d Last year the local paper ran a front-page headline saying just that. \u201cI thought, oh my God, what have I done?\u201d Roman was with her, and comforted her. \u201cBut it is true,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really lonely.\u201d\nFor the Povey family, the benefits of Molly\u2019s post are visible each day. His tearfulness has declined. The whole household is happier. Molly herself has found, in the Facebook page, a community that makes her feel supported and which, in turn, needs her. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve got a responsibility,\u201d Ian says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing.\u201d He himself has never read the initial post, usually declines to appear in photographs, and thinks that when it comes to sharing, \u201cIt\u2019s best to err on the side of caution.\u201d Occasionally, Molly tells her community that Roman is having a bad day, or that she is: she doesn\u2019t want to pretend to people who know loneliness that loneliness doesn\u2019t happen. And yet, as Ian says, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know sometimes what Roman really thinks about it.\u201d\nMolly leads the way up to Roman\u2019s bedroom, to show more of the gifts people sent. There is James Bond notepaper from the actor Andrew Scott, who played the baddie in Spectre, and a crew T-shirt from Star Wars: Episode III.\nI wonder if Roman minds thousands of strangers knowing he\u2019s sad. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d Molly asks him. \u201cDo you mind that people know you get really lonely?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Roman replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go yes: I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Molly repeats, incredulous.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, that people around the world know you are lonely?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it now?\u201d she asks again.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Molly says. She sounds deflated.\n\u201cIt just feels weird, it does,\u201d Roman tells her.\nAlthough Molly has publicly revealed aspects of her son\u2019s emotional life that other parents might hesitate to share, she is not incautious. For months she withheld Roman\u2019s full name and has only recently felt comfortable disclosing that he is autistic. Before her heartfelt post, she deleted baby pictures of Roman\u2019s older brother because he was about to start secondary school; surely the Kingsford debaters would approve.\nLike Alicia Blum-Ross and Heather Whitten, Molly has rules. \u201cThink about whether it\u2019s appropriate \u2013 if in a year or five years your child would be embarrassed by anything you\u2019ve done. And just why are you actually doing it? Is it a positive thing, or is it to give you a social boost as opposed to the children?\u201d Molly might appear to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from Tamasine Preece, who never posts, but the morals that underpin their behaviour are remarkably alike. And while Molly thinks \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be posting pictures of kids in the bath\u201d, in some ways her posts are as exposing as Whitten\u2019s.\nLater that evening Molly emails to say that the conversation with Roman had troubled her. After I\u2019d left the house, she offered to take down the page, she says, but Roman said not to. \u201cTurns out he was confused in his room and was talking about not liking being lonely, and not his page.\u201d\nOr maybe Roman, in that moment, wished no one knew he was lonely. Then, later, when his mother checked, he minded less. Or maybe he understands that the community his mother has created has benefited him and his family. But these are only guesses. It is impossible to know. He is young, and the world changes many times a day. His parents have his best interests at heart, but like any who share news of their children, every time they post, they cross a line between privacy and publicity. Where each parent sees the line is an unsteady, unsettleable question. For Roman, and others like him, the truth may be something they are still working out, or simply prefer not to share.\nElaine Star, 47, a PA and poet, and her youngest daughter Sadie, 17, a student, live in Brighton \nElaine I\u2019ve had a Facebook account for about 10 years, so Sadie was probably seven when I first joined. I use it to keep in touch with different groups of people \u2013 old friends, my poetry group, the puppet show I work with. I\u2019m also friends with a lot of my kids\u2019 friends, because it\u2019s often the best way of locating where mine are. I don\u2019t think it bothers them. All their friends are happy to come to the house and sit around my kitchen table and chat, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s odd. I don\u2019t post on their friends\u2019 pages \u2013 maybe just a \u201cHappy birthday\u201d message. But I\u2019m really impressed by the sorts of things they share about science, politics \u2013 they\u2019re very funny and insightful.\nI have definitely made mistakes online. I\u2019ve gone on after a few glasses of wine and said things I shouldn\u2019t have. There have been some angry messages about the state my kids and their friends have left the house in. And they have all asked me to take down various photos. I get it: I\u2019m sensitive to the fact that they\u2019re trying to be cool or whatever.\nI think I\u2019m past the stage of worrying too much about embarrassing my kids. I write poems that are very personal, and I share them on Facebook. But that\u2019s how I express myself. The kids have occasionally said, \u201cStop living your life on Facebook\u201d but I\u2019m an open person.\nThey\u2019re all fairly streetwise. We have a very open dialogue in our house. They have occasionally posted things that I think are a bit questionable \u2013 showing off a bit about drinking with their friends, that sort of thing. I might have said, \u201cHmm, you might want to think about that\u201d but I\u2019ve never said, \u201cTake that down.\u201d I\u2019m glad Facebook wasn\u2019t around to record my teenage years, though. I\u2019d hate it.\nSadie My siblings and I all use Facebook in different ways. Stevie posts a lot of pictures; Maisie likes to talk about stuff. Me and Joe post a lot of news stories, and I like posting videos or songs. I don\u2019t like to put up personal pictures, or get too emotional on Facebook. My mum\u2019s posts can be really personal.\nAt the beginning, I didn\u2019t really want to be friends with her on Facebook. I didn\u2019t really want her seeing pictures of me that my friends had posted. They weren\u2019t anything bad; they just felt like a bit of my life that was separate from her. Now I don\u2019t mind as much \u2013 I\u2019m more open. She\u2019s also friends with a lot of my friends on there. That\u2019s not a problem, except that she\u2019s quite free with what she writes. Something would happen between us, and she\u2019d put it in a poem, and post it to Facebook, and I wondered whether my friends would see her in a different way. I think maybe I felt protective of her. But no one has ever said anything.\nShe has a lot of photos of us when we were little. When I was a bit younger, I hated seeing some of them online. I remember there was one where I was holding my pet hamster and I just thought I looked greasy and rough. And once my room was really messy and my mum said, \u201cI\u2019ll take pictures and put it on Facebook.\u201d I would have hated it if she\u2019d actually done it. Now I\u2019m a bit older, I\u2019ve learned to let go of it all a bit more. I think I\u2019m OK with what\u2019s out there about me.\nJuliet Redelsperger-Talbot, 43, a marketing and events manager, and Nell, 13, live in Eye, Suffolk, with Nell\u2019s father and her brother Lawrence, 10 \nNell I\u2019ve been cyberbullied before. One of my followers on Instagram, someone I knew, turned on me, then a couple of others who I\u2019d thought were friendly were making comments on my posts. It wasn\u2019t nice, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to handle it. In school they give you lessons about what to do if it happens to you, but when it comes to it, the reality is very different. But the school did deal with it.\nAfter that, I became a lot more careful about who I accept as friends, and what people can see. Now I have one account for my photography and a separate one for my closest friends.\nI have looked briefly at Mum\u2019s Facebook account, but I don\u2019t have a clue about how Facebook works. I don\u2019t think I mind that there are photos of me. If you know the people that can see those photos, then that\u2019s OK. If it\u2019s not private, I\u2019m not so sure about that. But I don\u2019t find it embarrassing. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t feel like the same person I was when I was little. It doesn\u2019t feel as if those pictures are of me.\nJuliet The cyberbullying was a harrowing time for Nell, but what was good was that some of her friends were supportive and took screenshots of the comments as proof of what was happening. Nell was worried I would be angry, so she didn\u2019t come to me until after it was over. It was awful, but in a way, I think it helped her understand what you\u2019re exposed to online.\nNell is a great photographer, and she sends me pictures, but I check that she is happy before I post anything on Facebook. Your children have every right to veto what you put online, although they have to be a certain age before they understand what it means. Neither of mine have ever had an issue with something I\u2019ve posted, but then they\u2019re the generation that are used to having photos of themselves everywhere. I think it meant something different for my generation. It took so long to get photos developed that seeing yourself was so much more important.\nThe children were very little when I first signed up. I don\u2019t remember thinking much about privacy then. It wasn\u2019t until I read in the paper how posts about your children might be seen by complete strangers that I changed my settings.\nAs time went by, I began to feel uncomfortable about posting. It felt like everything online was becoming more about \u201cLook how wonderful I am\u201d and it made me feel quite down. So I left for a while. Eventually I rejoined because it was hard to keep up with everything. So now I\u2019ve started again but in a very different way.\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "From first smiles to teenage experiments, a generation of children has had their every move posted by their parents.

Ministry of Justice figures show that between June 1993 and June 2012 the prison population in England and Wales increased by 41,800 prisoners, to more than 86,000. Without urgent steps aimed at cutting the prison population this could exceed 100,000 by 2020. However, this has not been matched by a corresponding increase in the number of prison officers. On the contrary, their numbers have been cut.\nWhen our prisons are at crisis point, amid continuing controversy about incidents such as the recent killing at Pentonville, consider our direction of travel. Take HMP Berwyn, the so-called super prison expected to open in February 2017.\nBuilt at the cost of \u00a3212m and located at Wrexham in Wales, HMP Berwyn is expected to accommodate 2,100 category C prisoners \u2013 those who cannot be allowed to move freely but are considered unlikely to try to escape. Instead of taking steps to radically reduce the UK prison population the government keeps building more prisons to house even more prisoners.\nI have come across numerous cases over the years where a noncustodial sentence would have been more appropriate than imprisonment. I recall a heavily pregnant lady suffering from a life-threatening condition who was jailed for breaching a restraining order. What was to be expected of a pregnant sufferer confined for a good deal of the time in a small, poorly ventilated prison cell? During her time behind bars she was rushed to hospital several times. Whenever she was there, for sometimes up to a week and longer, she was guarded round the clock by prison officers.\nI recall another instance when the nurse, seeing the new arrivals on reception duty, sent me the following message, asking me to prescribe a short course of sleeping tablets for a recent arrival. She was in prison for failing to pay a bill. Her partner was supposed to be looking after their young children but, the message said: \u201cshe does not believe he is up to the task. She is in a very weepy state and unable to sleep. She has another four weeks to do \u2013 could you please help?\u201d\nThese women represent a not insignificant proportion of the prison population who are not a \u201cdanger to the public\u201d. So why is the state spending large sums to keep them behind bars?\nMinistry of Justice figures from 2013 revealed that 55% of prisoners connected their offences to drug-taking, with the need for money to buy drugs the most commonly cited factor. Eliminating the addiction factor could lead to the closure of about half the prisons in the UK and free resources for other matters.\nSending these people to jail in the hope of ridding society of the menace of drug abuse is a woefully inadequate approach to the complex problem of drugs. It is akin to a doctor treating the symptoms of a disease without concerning themselves with its cause or its future prevention. There should instead be a holistic approach to the problem of drug addiction, with treatment and rehabilitation forming the centrepiece.\nAnd then there are the inmates with mental health issues. Surely these are best handled in psychiatric institutions rather than prison. Instead of spending millions on \u201csuper prisons\u201d, the state would be better employed building additional psychiatric hospitals and homes to accommodate the hundreds, if not thousands, of them languishing in jail. Instead of helping them to overcome their mental impairment, society is punishing them for a condition they cannot help having. Labelling them criminals on a par with those who commit armed robbery, rape and murder is antiquated at best and nonsensical at worst. Samuel Butler lampooned this stance in his classic satire, Erewhon, describing a culture who imprisoned the sick for the crime of not being well. That was published in 1872, but what has changed since then?\nA report published last month by the RSA\u2019s Future Prison project says the prison and probation services in England and Wales are failing to protect the public because they do not rehabilitate offenders, and that they should be radically restructured. I welcome the rehabilitation aspect, but it still ignores the central issue of population.\nWe need urgently to address sentencing, because too many offenders are being sent to prison for short terms. A record-breaking case was that of a lady who was jailed one evening only to be released the next day. I believe any sentence below three months should be suspended, turned into fines or whatever other punishment society deems appropriate short of an actual prison sentence.\nAs for drug addicts, the power to sentence them to drug rehabilitation homes makes sense for everybody. Keeping the most dangerous criminals \u2013 sex offenders, murderers, terrorists, armed robbers, and so on \u2013 in jail, and finding alternative punishment for those committing petty crimes, would not only lead a radical reduction in the prison population, it would also allow for the proper supervision of extremely dangerous inmates.\nWhatever else is said this week, population reduction is where our focus is and it is quite achievable. What is really needed is the will.\n\u2022 Dr Gordon Cameron is a pseudonym. Memoirs of Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Doctor by Dr Cameron is available now.

Now imagine living through it all as a Muslim American. Somehow, this election has managed to cram all the Islamophobic sentiments of the last 15 years into the span of 15 months, and then morph them into one ugly thing.\nDonald Trump is largely to blame. He called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country until it became clear that the proposal was embarrassingly ill-conceived, only to be replaced by the equally vague \u201cextreme vetting\u201d. He fought publicly with the Gold Star Khan family, suggesting Ghazala Khan was not \u201callowed to speak\u201d at the Democratic convention because of her Muslim faith. He accused Muslim Americans as a group of harboring terrorists. There\u2019s more, but we all know the story by now.\nTrump has insulted and defamed many different groups along the way, but what we may not realize is how it\u2019s different when it comes to Muslims. Over the course of the campaign, Trump has very publicly reached out to Latino, African American and LGBTQ voters to ask for their support. We can question his sincerity, but the gestures are there. He even briefly tempered his tone regarding Mexicans during a quickly arranged visit to President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City last August. \nHis daughter Ivanka and wife Melania have defended him for his unforgivable behavior toward women, and Ivanka also recorded an official campaign television advertisement openly courting women voters for her father. Trump denies the charge he mocked a disabled reporter, and despite a bevy of antisemitic incidents involving Trump and his supporters over the past months, he has also directly sought Jewish American support. Such is his style of leadership: he may insult you, but he still wants your vote. \nNot so with the Muslims. A tiny handful of Muslim Americans may, bizarrely, be Trump supporters, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that, while attempting to engage every other constituency, Trump\u2019s campaign has made essentially zero public outreach to the Muslim electorate. It\u2019s as if Muslim citizens already don\u2019t exist in Trump\u2019s America.\nThe irony is that Trump\u2019s willful blindness to Muslim voters may lead to his defeat. Muslims may only account for a small part of the American population, but a concerted push by Muslim Americans during this season has meant that there are now over a million registered Muslim voters, more than double the number in 2012. And Muslims tend to live in key battleground states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. \nBut Hillary Clinton may not be able to count on all of those votes either. Many Muslim Americans have long been uncomfortable with her hawkish foreign policy record and her superficially inclusive rhetoric. \u201cWe need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our frontlines,\u201d is a standard Clinton refrain, and with it we hear the suggestion that our communities live on some kind of \u201cfrontline\u201d of warfare. \nThis is so not true: the front line of Costco, maybe. Most Muslim Americans are boring, middle-class folk. Clinton also seems to see Muslim Americans as separate from her idea of \u201cwe\u201d (\u201cwe\u201d need \u201cthem\u201d to be part of \u201cus\u201d) and to believe that we, as a group, carry some insider knowledge about evildoers that we may \u2013 or may not! \u2013 be willing to trade in exchange for equal treatment in the United States. \nThis is offensive to our citizenship, and Muslim Americans must be afforded the same rights and protections as everyone else without precondition. But what this campaign has really shown is how contested and precarious the place is for Muslim Americans today. That won\u2019t change after 8 November, regardless of who wins. \nEven with a Clinton victory, Trump and his \u201cmovement\u201d, which is how he refers to his campaign, will not simply vanish. And the suggestion that Trump is merely using the election as a platform from which to start a new media empire is hardly comforting, as if there has never been a connection between mass media and far-right politics. So how prepared are we, as a nation, to deal with Trumpism after Tuesday?\nIf there\u2019s any good news to come out of this election, it\u2019s that the country now recognizes the potent political force that is Islamophobia. And Americans are beginning to understand that fighting anti-Muslim bigotry is not fundamentally about protecting Muslims, but about preserving the vision of a functioning, pluralistic and democratic society. Now we must be prepared to do the work necessary to hold our leaders to that standard every day, and not just once every four years.\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "The GOP candidate insulted many minority groups, but he also tried to win their votes.

But if I were to rely upon how television drama has interpreted the story of my generation, I would not be able to recognise it. Sadly, dramas about events that occurred in my youth deal almost exclusively with the pageant of nobility.\nIt concerns me that the history of my generation may be lost to my grandchildren because television producers would rather anaesthetise viewers from the unpleasantness of our past with idolatry for the aristocracy and the monarchy.\nIt\u2019s why I am angry that Netflix has spent $130m (\u00a3105m) on the 10-part series The Crown. This is a biopic concerning the marriage of Queen Elizabeth when she was still a princess in 1947, followed by her coronation in 1953. Unfortunately, The Crown views postwar Britain from the perspective of our sovereign and all who inhabited her world. This does an enormous disservice to the epoch, because it was a time when a socialist tide raised all boats. History was literally being made from the bottom up because, while Princess Elizabeth was being fitted for her wedding dress, ordinary Britons were dismantling a thousand years of feudal mentality through the creation of the welfare state.\nWe\u2019ve seen this approach before. Nothing better illustrates TV\u2019s lush treacle homage to the landed gentry than Downton Abbey, a drama that ran for six series as a parlour-room interpretation of historical moments that shaped Britain at the turn of the 20th century. But Downton has not been the exception to the rule, rather a template used by TV and movie producers to crush the truth from history and make the entitled the heroes of narratives about our nation\u2019s collective past.\nThe Crown, like Downton Abbey, Victoria or even Indian Summers, depicts moments in history as a pageant in which the wealthy, the entitled and the nobility oversee the lives of millions with benevolence, wisdom and grace. As I have been both a witness to and participant in history since 1923, I can tell you that was not the case. Millions lived lives of abject misery during the 1930s while the 1% of that time enjoyed an obscene opulence. Despite the vast wealth of 19th-century history a TV dramatist can draw upon, our nation\u2019s rich heritage too often becomes an infomercial for monarchy and empire.\nThe Crown is like an expensive painting in which the only subjects in focus are the rich and privileged. Everyone else, people like me or your grandparents if they came from the working class and even the middle class, are considered no more than background scenery. We are the undefined face in the crowd waving religiously at our so-called betters.\nTo my mind, The Crown is an insult to the struggles my generation overcame and the triumphs we earned from our sacrifices in both war and in peace. But what is most frightening is that the tableau of our past shown on Netflix and other TV networks will be most people\u2019s window on my generation\u2019s history. Too many in the 19th and early 20th century lived thwarted lives because of the exploitation they endured in the mines and mills. Yet no one tells the tale of these workers unionising, fighting for their rights or trying to find and maintain love in the harsh conditions of the slums they called home.\nToo many of my generation died young because they lacked the money to pay for a doctor, but in The Crown our sympathies are directed to a king dying of lung cancer rather than the thousands of miners who died painfully of black lung because that monarch and his society didn\u2019t believe the average citizen deserved medicine if they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for it.\nOur Queen, no matter how much we should respect her service to the state, doesn\u2019t deserve to be turned into a cinematic icon. In the great sweep of events our monarch is like a garden ornament sitting immutably on the field of history because she is not the author of our nation\u2019s destiny.\nBecause of austerity and Brexit, Britain has become a house divided. We need now more than ever our great film-makers and television producers to tell the stories from our collective past that reflect all its pathos and wonder. And they need to tell it from the perspective of those ordinary, brilliant and profound men and women who, a lifetime ago, helped shape the way we live today through their deeds.\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "Netflix\u2019s lavish portrayal of the Queen joins a long line of period dramas that ignore the lives of ordinary men and women", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/the-crown-portrayal-of-history-insult-to-my-generations-struggles", "title": "The Crown\u2019s portrayal of history is an insult to my generation\u2019s  struggles | Harry Leslie Smith"}, "153": {"text": "We all believe in freedom of speech. But freedom of speech must be exercised responsibly. Last Thursday\u2019s judgment from the high court on article 50 led to artificial hysteria in many quarters. There were headlines declaring that the judges who heard the case were \u201cEnemies of the people\u201d; references alluding to the sexuality of a judge briefly appeared on the Daily Mail\u2019s website; and a member of the cabinet, Sajid Javid, ominously stated that \u201cThis is an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people and it is unacceptable\u201d.\nMany have said that those headlines and comments \u201ccrossed the line\u201d. And in our constitution, when judicial independence is threatened, the lord chancellor has a legal duty to intervene. Liz Truss, however, failed to say anything for nearly 48 hours and when she did, she simply recited the principle of the independence of the judiciary and stated the government would be appealing against the judgment. She did not condemn the fact that our judges had been declared \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, nor that the sexuality of a judge had been introduced in to the debate.\nWhen Truss took office she swore an oath to uphold the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. In her speech that day she committed to doing so \u201cwith dedication\u201d. The headlines which appeared in a number of newspapers the day after the high court ruling in the article 50 case was the first test of her commitment. On any reasonable measure, she failed that test.\nThat\u2019s not just my view. The former lord chief justice, Lord Judge, was interviewed on Radio 4 on Sunday and said this: \u201cThe lord chancellor has a specific function and in this case her responsibility, where there has been vituperative criticism of judges, damaging to public confidence in the administration of justice by an independent judiciary, is to speak up for them and explain exactly what the principles are.\u201d\nHe went on to say about Truss\u2019s response to the attacks: \u201cI think it was a little too late and I think it\u2019s quite a lot too little. Because it doesn\u2019t actually address the damage to public confidence consequent on [these] kind of headlines.\u201d\nDuring my 10 years as a lawyer before being elected to parliament and then becoming shadow lord chancellor, there were occasions when I disagreed with \u2013 or was disappointed with \u2013 judges\u2019 decisions. When I lost a case, I was disappointed. When I won a case, the lawyer on the other side was disappointed. But we would never tolerate our judiciary being declared as \u201cagainst the people\u201d or a judge\u2019s sexuality being brought into the debate.\nAnyone is free to disagree with a judge\u2019s decision, their reasoning \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 or their interpretation of the law. But what is surely unacceptable is attacks on the independence of the judiciary by government ministers and powerful government-backing newspapers. The lord chancellor has a duty to act in these circumstances and she failed.\nIt took a bar council resolution demanding action to draw her into the open. And then she provided a statement carefully crafted to say as little as possible, which has only attracted further criticism. And since then she has remained out of sight. Conservative MPs mindful of the rule of law have criticised her publicly and, reportedly, privately, at a fractious meeting of Tory MPs at which she is supposed to have said that it is the job of the lord chief justice to defend the judiciary. Actually, it is Truss\u2019s statutory responsibility \u2013 and the lord chief justice is one of the judges who heard the case and is being maligned.\nI know Truss has a lot on, given the crisis of violence and underfunding that has developed in our prison service, but for many in the legal community, studied silence on this specific matter means a lord chancellor loses their trust and confidence. Her failure to speak out has consequences: only yesterday afternoon, during a debate on Brexit in the Commons, David Davis repeatedly failed to condemn the headlines when asked. Other MPs have spoken about the judiciary \u201cinterfering between parliament and the executive\u201d.\nWhether it\u2019s respecting the outcome of referendums (even when the result disappoints the Labour party) or defending the independence of the judiciary, Labour is the party of the rule of law.

I have seen grown men brought almost to tears discussing its bedding selection and choice of lightbulbs. I\u2019ve sat through literally hours of office chat about its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d commitment and geisha-like customer service. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s where people have their wedding lists.\nAll of which makes the fact that John Lewis is moving into the sticky-fingered business of bikini waxes all the more disquieting.\nNow, let us be clear \u2013 your hair is your hair and you have complete authority over what you do with it. You can thank the My Body, My Rules school of feminism for that. But, when it comes to the decision between haberdashery and hair removal, I\u2019m afraid I have to take issue with the latter.\nWhen the Sunday Times, after interviewing John Lewis\u2019s new managing director, Paula Nickolds (who in fact started her career in the sewing department of the organisation), says that the \u201ctraditional products, including hats and haberdashery, are being downgraded in favour of new services, including holidays, in-store prosecco bars and bikini waxes\u201d it makes me want to weave myself a row-boat out of leg hair and sail away to the horizon.\nJohn Lewis today reassured customers that they \u201chave no plans to close or downgrade our haberdashery departments. Haberdashery is woven into the fabric of our business and there are no plans to unstitch it.\u201d But such rumours are unnerving, not least because the better part of life lies in creating things, not ripping them out. As women \u2013 and let\u2019s be honest, women are more likely to be booking in for John Lewis bikini waxes than men \u2013 we should aspire to be making things, rather than removing them. To sew your own is an act of creative independence; hair removal and prosecco bars simply fuel the endemic belief that our bodies are flawed and we need \u201cprofessionals\u201d to fix them or drown our sorrows.\nThe idea that shopping and \u201cpampering\u201d are a \u201cleisure day out\u201d as Nickolds claims, is a bare-thighed lie. There is nothing leisurely about disliking your own legs. There is nothing relaxing, luxurious or indulgent about covering your nadgers with hot wax and ripping out the evidence of an adult, mammalian body. I\u2019ve had less painful rock-climbing accidents than the one time I tried to wax the back of my thighs. And at the risk of going full Trotsky on your nether regions, the removal of pubic hair is yet another way that capitalism plays on personal insecurities to make money from your body. And we don\u2019t have to go along with it if we don\u2019t want to.\nOn the other hand, taking on the active, creative, expressive role of maker is genuinely galvanising. In June I went to Berlin for the summer, armed with little more than my sewing machine. Over the next three months I created almost everything I wore with my own hands. There was a dress made from antique soviet linen bought on the corner of Boxhagener Platz, a pair of trousers made from Neuk\u00f6lln cotton, a bridesmaid dress made from a roll of silk found behind a box of potatoes at the T\u00fcrkischer Markt, numerous jumpsuits, shorts, shirts and vests \u2013 all made on my bedroom floor using a machine I inherited from my great-aunt Margaret. Those items weren\u2019t only cheap, didn\u2019t just fit me, didn\u2019t just keep me off the streets for an hour at a time, but will serve as a lifelong reminder of a wonderful trip and the fact that, despite what the fashion industry may tell us, we can all do it ourselves.\nMany of my friends would no doubt be thrilled to their very pudenda at the idea of a John Lewis wax. As leisure activities go, it at least gives money to one of our last employee-owned companies and might be more fun than pole-dancing classes or throwing up sambuca into a sticky bin outside Flares. But my generation needs materials, tools and the confidence to do it themselves, not \u201cme time\u201d, prosecco and plucked genitals.\nWhen tearing out your pubic hair and slapping on grease become genuinely uplifting acts of self-empowerment then sports societies will stop using them as hazing initiation rites. In the meantime, you\u2019ll find me, crouched over my sewing machine, making yet another outfit.

But its work has been hampered by serious policy differences between the party and its coalition partners \u2013 the left-leaning Social Democrats and conservative IRL Party. \nConflicting views over taxation and improving the state of Estonia\u2019s economy, which the two junior coalition partners claim is stagnant, is the main cause for the breakup. \nBut political observers in the country say the other parties have also grown tired of the long reign and style of the centre-right Reform party, which has led governments since 2005 and was part of every coalition for the past 17 years. \nThe crisis escalated earlier this week as the Social Democrats and IRL urged R\u00f5ivas \u2013 at 37, one of Europe\u2019s youngest heads of government \u2013 to resign, saying they had lost trust in his leadership and Reform\u2019s economic policies. \n", "tags": ["politics"], "abstract": "Taavi R\u00f5ivas loses parliament vote 63-28 as president urges heads of country\u2019s six parties to form new government", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/estonias-prime-minister-loses-confidence-vote", "title": "Estonia's government collapses as PM loses confidence vote"}, "156": {"text": "The EU is proposing to spend hundreds of millions of euros to help the budding ocean energy industry to provide a tenth of the bloc\u2019s power by 2050.\nThe boost would take the form of a \u20ac250m investment fund, with an additional \u20ac70m set aside for insurance, loans and guarantees, according to the roadmap for channelling the potential of wave and tidal energy.\nThe money would be supplied by the EU and its member states and should work as a buffer for companies that are attempting to cross the \u201cvalley of death\u201d between demonstration projects and the energy market.\n\u201cIt is a comprehensive, inclusive and ambitious plan for building up ocean energy in Europe \u2013 from the initial R&D all the way to the industrial roll-out,\u201d said the EU\u2019s environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella, at a launch meeting in Brussels.\nR\u00e9mi Gruet, the CEO of trade group Ocean Energy Europe, said: \u201cBridging the gap between risk-averse commercial lenders and public authorities with limited budgets requires rethinking project finance.

The vast majority of incidents involved eastern Europeans, with more attacks against Poles than all other nationalities combined.\nFraser, who is a specialist in the Middle East and European trade, was the Foreign Office permanent under-secretary for William Hague and Philip Hammond between 2010 and 2015. \nHe is concerned that Theresa May\u2019s cabinet is insufficiently aware of the way in which European opinion is hardening against the UK, and fears that the chances of reaching a rational outcome with the EU on a future relationship are being damaged by UK rhetoric.\nFor Brexit Britain to remain a heavy hitter in international diplomacy, it would require new resources, more diplomats and a more active foreign policy. At present, he said, the UK spent more annually on the winter fuel allowance than on the Foreign Office, while the department\u2019s budget was only twice the UK aid budget to Ethiopia.\n\u201cMy concern is, whatever our ambition and intent, the process of our EU separation will suck our policy and political energy inwards, far more so if it leads to an existential crisis over Scotland or a deterioration of peace and and security in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. \n\u201cOther countries that had the UK down as a stable and active player in world affairs are unsure at the moment where we are heading.\u201d\nAlthough he insisted Britain could yet retain global influence outside the EU, through other international institutions such as Nato and the UN, Fraser warned there was no point denying that the decision to leave affected how the UK conducted foreign policy.\nTo tackle the problem Fraser urged a revamp of Whitehall departments, saying May had fragmented the international effort, with six different government departments now leading on foreign and security policy.\nHe said the Foreign Office should be handed the same coordinating role over foreign affairs as the Treasury enjoys over economic policy. He suggested the Department of International Development and the Department of International Trade could be incorporated into the Foreign Office.\nHe disclosed Whitehall was facing \u201can uphill struggle\u201d to respond to Brexit and that since there had been no planning for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, Whitehall was still in the process of analysing options for a future relationship. The Foreign Office in particular was preparing an initiative setting out how the UK could retain close security and foreign policy relations with the EU, even though in future it will be excluded from its meetings and denied access to papers.\nFraser said continued diplomatic and security influence would come with continued economic success, and urged the government not to imagine it would be easy to build a new economic relationship away from the EU. \u201cThat is why a rational outcome on our future relationship with the EU single market is essential,\u201d he said\nFraser also urged the cabinet not to think Britain could build a reliable economic future by engaging only with non-European countries such as China and India. \u201cWe export more to Belgium at the moment than we do to India, Russia Brazil and South Africa combined,\u201d he said. Although UK trade with these countries was growing, the structure of UK trade was not going to shift rapidly. Geographical proximity remained a huge determinant of a country\u2019s trading relationships he said.\nBritain had to acknowledge that its most important international relations would remain those with the United States, Germany and France. \nAnd in pointed advice, possibly to the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, he said: \u201cA good start would be to listen to those around them that have experience and knowledge of how the EU works, the complex issues they will need to negotiate and what the people on the other side of the table will be thinking.\u201d\n\n", "tags": ["politics"], "abstract": "Sir Simon Fraser, who headed the Foreign Office, says economic stability essential if Britain is to retain place in world diplomacy", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/08/uk-risks-losing-global-influence-quits-single-market-senior-civil-servant", "title": "UK risks losing global influence if it quits single market, says senior civil servant"}, "160": {"text": "US military scientists have used electrical brain stimulators to enhance mental skills of staff, in research that aims to boost the performance of air crews, drone operators and others in the armed forces\u2019 most demanding roles.\nThe successful tests of the devices pave the way for servicemen and women to be wired up at critical times of duty, so that electrical pulses can be beamed into their brains to improve their effectiveness in high pressure situations.\nThe brain stimulation kits use five electrodes to send weak electric currents through the skull and into specific parts of the cortex. Previous studies have found evidence that by helping neurons to fire, these minor brain zaps can boost cognitive ability.\nThe technology is seen as a safer alternative to prescription drugs, such as modafinil and ritalin, both of which have been used off-label as performance enhancing drugs in the armed forces. \nBut while electrical brain stimulation appears to have no harmful side effects, some experts say its long-term safety is unknown, and raise concerns about staff being forced to use the equipment if it is approved for military operations. \nOthers are worried about the broader implications of the science on the general workforce because of the advance of an unregulated technology.\nIn a new report, scientists at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio describe how the performance of military personnel can slump soon after they start work if the demands of the job become too intense. \n\u201cWithin the air force, various operations such as remotely piloted and manned aircraft operations require a human operator to monitor and respond to multiple events simultaneously over a long period of time,\u201d they write. \u201cWith the monotonous nature of these tasks, the operator\u2019s performance may decline shortly after their work shift commences.\u201d\nBut in a series of experiments at the air force base, the researchers found that electrical brain stimulation can improve people\u2019s multitasking skills and stave off the drop in performance that comes with information overload. Writing in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, they say that the technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has a \u201cprofound effect\u201d.\nFor the study, the scientists had men and women at the base take a test developed by Nasa to assess multitasking skills. The test requires people to keep a crosshair inside a moving circle on a computer screen, while constantly monitoring and responding to three other tasks on the screen. \nTo investigate whether tDCS boosted people\u2019s scores, half of the volunteers had a constant two milliamp current beamed into the brain for the 36-minute-long test. The other half formed a control group and had only 30 seconds of stimulation at the start of the test.\nAccording to the report, the brain stimulation group started to perform better than the control group four minutes into the test. \u201cThe findings provide new evidence that tDCS has the ability to augment and enhance multitasking capability in a human operator,\u201d the researchers write. Larger studies must now look at whether the improvement in performance is real and, if so, how long it lasts.\nThe tests are not the first to claim beneficial effects from electrical brain stimulation. Last year, researchers at the same US facility found that tDCS seemed to work better than caffeine at keeping military target analysts vigilant after long hours at the desk. Brain stimulation has also been tested for its potential to help soldiers spot snipers more quickly in VR training programmes.\nNeil Levy, deputy director of the Oxford Centre for Neuroethics, said that compared with prescription drugs, electrical brain stimulation could actually be a safer way to boost the performance of those in the armed forces. \u201cI have more serious worries about the extent to which participants can give informed consent, and whether they can opt out once it is approved for use,\u201d he said. \u201cEven for those jobs where attention is absolutely critical, you want to be very careful about making it compulsory, or there being a strong social pressure to use it, before we are really sure about its long-term safety.\u201d\nBut while the devices may be safe in the hands of experts, the technology is freely available, because the sale of brain stimulation kits is unregulated. They can be bought on the internet or assembled from simple components, which raises a greater concern, according to Levy. Young people whose brains are still developing may be tempted to experiment with the devices, and try higher currents than those used in laboratories, he says. \u201cIf you use high currents you can damage the brain,\u201d he says.\nIn 2014 another Oxford scientist, Roi Cohen Kadosh, warned that while brain stimulation could improve performance at some tasks, it made people worse at others. In light of the work, Kadosh urged people not to use brain stimulators at home.\nIf the technology is proved safe in the long run though, it could help those who need it most, said Levy. \u201cIt may have a levelling-up effect, because it is cheap and enhancers tend to benefit the people that perform less well,\u201d he said.\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Study paves way for personnel such as drone operators to have electrical pulses sent into their brains to improve effectiveness in high pressure situations", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/07/us-military-successfully-tests-electrical-brain-stimulation-to-enhance-staff-skills", "title": "US military successfully tests electrical brain stimulation to enhance staff skills"}, "161": {"text": "Ecosystems in the southern hemisphere bounced back more than twice as quickly as those in the north after the devastating asteroid impact that annihilated the dinosaurs, research suggests.\nA mass extinction was triggered 66 million years ago when a huge extraterrestrial rock crashed into the Earth. It produced the Chicxulub crater off the coast of Mexico as well as wiping out non-avian dinosaurs and a vast array of other species.\nWhile previous evidence had suggested that the effects of the impact might have been less severe in the southern hemisphere, possibly because it provided a sort of refuge for species, the new research hints at a different explanation. \nThe lesser severity apparently seen in the southern hemisphere could be down to ecosystems recovering more quickly, researchers have found.\n\u201cThis extinction event is very important \u2013 it is a one of the major extinctions in the history of the Earth,\u201d said Michael Donovan of Pennsylvania State University, a co-author of the research published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. \n\u201cThe biodiversity patterns we see today, where things are living, may be related to what survived \u2013 so it is important to learn about what was happening around the world at this time,\u201d he added.\nTo unpick why life in the southern hemisphere appeared to have fared better in the aftermath of the impact than in the north, scientists looked at the effect of the asteroid strike on leaf-eating insects. \u201cWe can learn a lot about what was happening at the base of the ecosystems by looking at what is happening to the plants and insects,\u201d said Donovan.\nThe team, from the USA and Argentina, analysed 3,646 fossil leaves from Patagonia dating from around a million years before the impact to around four million years after the event. The analysis focused on comparing damage produced by the nibbling of insects to that previously seen in fossil leaves from the western interior of North America.\nThe North American leaves revealed that the diversity of damage, and therefore the variety of insects munching on the leaves, decreased dramatically at the time of the asteroid impact, with insects that fed on just a small selection of plants the worst hit. The data also showed that it took around nine million years for insect damage to recover to pre-impact levels. \nSimilar trends were seen in the fossil leaves from Patagonia. However, both before and after the asteroid impact the diversity of damage was higher, suggesting that Patagonia was rich in a huge variety of insects. What\u2019s more, the diversity of the leaf damage returned to pre-impact levels more quickly than in North America, taking just four million years.\nCareful analysis of details in the damage produced by insects that burrow between leaf layers - so-called leaf miners - offered further insights, revealing that even though the same type of insects existed in Patagonia before and after the impact, they were unlikely to be of the same species. \u201cIt makes it look like there is a lower extinction, but ... there\u2019s actually new insects that were making this damage,\u201d said Donovan.\nThe upshot, the authors conclude, is that the catastrophic impact that bumped off the dinosaurs had a huge and devastating effect on insect biodiversity in both hemispheres, but that ecosystems recovered more quickly in Patagonia than in the western interior of North America. Given the crucial role plant-eating insects in food chains it is feasible, Donovan adds, that \u201cquicker recovery may be a general trend\u201d across the southern hemisphere. \nWhile it is not clear why ecosystems recovered faster in Patagonia, Donovan believes one factor could be its greater distance from the site of the asteroid strike, although he adds that is unlikely to be the full story. \nJason Hilton, a palaeobotanist from the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research, said the work convincingly showed that diversity in the southern hemisphere was as severely affected by the mass extinction 66 million years ago as it was in North America, overturning the idea that the southern hemisphere was a refuge for species. \n\u201cDifferent locations were devastated by the impact event triggering mass extinction but its effects lasted longer in some places than others,\u201d he said.\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Analysis of insect damage to fossil leaves presents new theory as to why southern hemisphere recovered faster from asteroid that killed the dinosaurs", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/07/southern-hemisphere-fastest-to-recover-after-dinosaur-killer-asteroid-study-suggests", "title": "Southern hemisphere faster to recover after killer asteroid, study suggests"}, "162": {"text": "Even by world record standards, it sets a high bar for human performance. Next month in Las Vegas a chess player named Timur Gareyev plans to take on nearly 50 opponents at once. But that is not the hard part. While his challengers will play the games as normal, Gareyev himself will be blindfolded.\nThe 28-year-old already stands out in the rarefied world of blindfold chess. He has a fondness for bright clothes, a hairstyle that morphs from mane to mohican, and he gets his kicks from Base jumping. He has proved himself a contender, too. In a 10-hour chess marathon in 2013, Gareyev played 33 games in his head simultaneously. He won 29 and lost none. The skill has become his brand: he calls himself the Blindfold King.\nBut Gareyev\u2019s prowess has drawn interest from beyond the chess-playing community. In the hope of understanding how he and others like him can perform such mental feats, researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles called him in for memory tests and brain scans. They now have their first results.\n\u201cThe ability to play a game of chess with your eyes closed is not a far reach for most accomplished players,\u201d said Jesse Rissman, who runs a memory lab at UCLA. \u201cBut the thing that\u2019s so remarkable about Timur and a few other individuals is the number of games they can keep active at once. To me it is simply astonishing.\u201d\nGareyev learned to play chess in Tashkent when he was six years old. Tutored by his grandfather, he entered his first tournament aged eight and soon became obsessed with competitions. At 16, he was crowned Asia\u2019s youngest ever chess grandmaster. He moved to the US soon after, where his obsession switched to poker, but as a student he still helped the University of Texas in Brownsville win its first national chess championship. In 2013, Gareyev was ranked the third best chess player in the US.\nTo the uninitiated, blindfold chess seems to call for superhuman skill. But displays of the feat, also known as sans voir, go back centuries. The first recorded game in Europe played out in 13th-century Florence. In 1947, the Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf played 45 simultaneous games in his mind. He won 39 times in the 24-hour session and was reportedly unable to sleep for three days afterwards. For the Blindfold King\u2019s crown to sit more comfortably, he must beat the record 46 games played at once by the German Marc Lang in 2011.\nAccomplished players can learn to play blind even without realising it. The nature of the game is to run through possible moves in the mind to see how they play out. From this, regular players develop a memory for the patterns the pieces make, the defences and attacks. \u201cYou recreate it in your mind,\u201d said Gareyev. \u2018A lot of players are capable of doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nThe real mental challenge comes from playing multiple games at once in the head. Not only must the positions of each piece on every board be memorised, they must be recalled faithfully when needed, updated with each player\u2019s moves, and then reliably stored again, so the brain can move on to the next board. Gareyev said that to remember each board, he must be focused and deliberate. \u201cIf I skip from one board to another too quickly, when I come back to it, it\u2019s not perfect and at times I\u2019ll mess up.\u201d First moves can be tough to remember because they are often so humdrum: a pawn in front of the king or queen advances two squares. But the end games are taxing too, as exhaustion sets in. When Gareyev is tired, his recall can get patchy. He sometimes makes moves based on only a fragmented memory of the pieces\u2019 positions.\nTo train for the record attempt, Gareyev has been on a chess tour that builds in a hefty schedule of exercise and yoga backed up with healthy eating. Next week, he will play ten games blindfolded at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego. At the same conference, Rissman\u2019s team will unveil the latest results from their tests on the player.\nThe scientists first had Gareyev perform some standard memory tests. These assessed his ability to hold numbers, pictures and words in mind. One classic test measures how many numbers a person can repeat, both forwards and backwards, soon after hearing them. Most people manage about seven. \u201cHe was not exceptional on any of these standard tests,\u201d said Rissman. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find anything other than playing chess that he seems to be supremely gifted at.\u201d\nBut next came the brain scans. With Gareyev lying down in the machine, Rissman looked at how well connected the various regions of the chess player\u2019s brain were. Though tentative and as yet unpublished, the scans found much greater than average communication between parts of Gareyev\u2019s brain that make up what is called the frontoparietal control network. Of 63 people scanned alongside the chess player, only one or two scored more highly on the measure. \u201cYou use this network in almost any complex task. It helps you to allocate attention, keep rules in mind, and work out whether you should be responding or not,\u201d said Rissman.\nIt was not the only hint of something special in Gareyev\u2019s brain. The scans also suggest that Gareyev\u2019s visual network is more highly connected to other brain parts than usual. If confirmed in further work, the areas of his brain that process visual images - such as chess boards - may have stronger links to other brain regions, and so be more powerful than normal. While the analyses are not finalised yet, they may hold the first clues to Gareyev\u2019s extraordinary ability.\nFor the world record attempt, a blindfolded Gareyev hopes to play 47 games at once in about 16 hours. He will need to win 80% to claim the title. \u201cI don\u2019t worry too much about the winning percentage, that\u2019s never been an issue for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important part of blindfold chess for me is that I have found the one thing that I can fully dedicate myself to. I miss having an obsession.\u201d\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Next month, Timur Gareyev will play nearly 50 opponents at once - blindfolded.

The idea that a useless sugar pill or harmless saline injection could result in a measurable improvement in a patient\u2019s symptoms, sometimes as good as taking an active drug, has been so hard to explain that some have even doubted whether it can be real.\nHowever, there is now evidence showing some people, known as \u201cplacebo responders\u201d, do feel or get better after unwittingly, or even wittingly, taking a placebo \u2013 and it\u2019s not just psychosomatic. Several studies are pointing to a biological basis for the placebo effect, with the latest research focused on a region of the brain known as the mid-frontal gyrus, which runs along the frontal lobes just above the eyes.\nThe study, carried out by Marwan Baliki and Vania Apkarian at Northwestern University in Chicago, involved a small number of chronic-pain patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. It is a rare example of a placebo study based on real patients rather than healthy volunteers who are just exposed to pain-inducing experiments to see how they feel when given a placebo.\nBaliki used an MRI scanner to observe in real time how the brain of patients responded to a placebo \u2013 in this case a sugar pill instead of a painkiller. In short, he found that an area within the mid-frontal gyrus lit up or, in his own words, \u201cshowed a higher functional connectivity\u201d in patients who responded to the placebo, compared with non-responders.\nHe concluded that this brain region seemed to be quite separate from another region of the brain known to be involved in responding to the effects of real painkilling drugs. In other words, Baliki appeared to have found the \u201cseat\u201d of the placebo effect within the brain.\n\u201cIn simple terms, we pinpointed a brain region, a hotspot or seat, that can predict the propensity of a patient\u2019s response to a placebo within the wider patient population suffering from chronic pain,\u201d Baliki says. \u201cWe also examined the specificity of our results by testing whether this hotspot can predict pain analgesia to an active drug. We found that it does not, suggesting that this brain region is specific for placebo analgesia.\u201d\nThe findings suggest a biological basis for the placebo effect and raise the prospect of tests to see if individuals are going to be good placebo responders or not. For those who are responders, it could mean targeting them with placebo pain treatments that might work specifically for them. Or it could result in identifying placebo responders so that they don\u2019t get included in clinical trials, which have long been thought to be compromised by them.\nIt is not, however, the first time that scientists have identified a brain region involved in the placebo effect. In 2007 for instance Jon-Kar Zubieta, now at the University of Utah, suggested that the nucleus accumbens, which lies at the top of the brain stem, plays a role in moderating pain after injections of a placebo composed of harmless saline solution \u2013 at least in healthy volunteers.\nOther researchers, meanwhile, have focused on identifying the genetic basis of the placebo effect. This is based on the idea that certain signalling pathways in the brain, especially those involved in the \u201creward\u201d network, help to mediate the placebo effect. The idea is that these signalling pathways are under genetic control and that some people may be blessed with certain combinations of genes that make them more or less responsive to a placebo effect.\nCertainly, the more that scientists investigate the placebo, the weirder the effect seems to be. One study earlier this year found that taking a placebo for chronic lower back pain can work effectively for some people even when they are told that the treatment is just a \u201cpowerful placebo\u201d.\n\u201cOur data suggests that harnessing placebo effects without deception is possible in the context of a plausible rationale,\u201d explained Claudia Carvalho of the ISPA-Instituto Universitario in Lisbon. She found that this kind of \u201copen\u201d placebo reduced initial pain and disability by about 30%.\nAnother study in 2011 on asthma patients found that placebo inhalers had no effect on increasing lung function. But asthma patients nevertheless reported that they felt significantly better after using a \u201cuseless\u201d inhaler \u2013 a baffling result to say the least.\nBut if this is difficult to explain, then what about the \u201cnoncebo\u201d, the evil twin of the placebo, where a sugar pill actually makes people feel worse because they expect to suffer the side effects they have heard about? If the placebo effect has a genuine biological basis, with a seat in the brain and its own set of genes, then it\u2019s plausible the same is true for the noncebo. If that is found to be the case, things could get really interesting.\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "A study of the sometimes positive effects of taking drug-free pills suggests a biological factor at work", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/06/placebo-effect-is-there-something-in-it", "title": "The placebo effect: is there something in it after all?"}, "164": {"text": "The devastating impact of cigarette smoke on the body\u2019s DNA has been laid bare by the first comprehensive study into the damage tobacco inflicts on human cells.\nPeople who smoke a pack of cigarettes each day for a year develop on average 150 extra mutations in every lung cell, and nearly 100 more mutations than usual in each cell of the voice box, researchers found. More still build up in the mouth, bladder, liver and other organs.\nWhile chemicals in tobacco smoke have long been known to raise the risk of at least 17 forms of cancer, the precise molecular mechanisms through which they mutate DNA and give rise to tumours in different tissues have never been clear.\n\u201cThis is about running down the root cause of cancers,\u201d said David Phillips, a professor of environmental carcinogenesis at King\u2019s College London and a co-author on the study. \u201cBy identifying the root causes, we gain the sort of knowledge we need to think more seriously about cancer prevention.\u201d\nMore than 70 of the 7,000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke are known to cause cancer. Some damage DNA directly, but others ramp up mutations in more subtle ways, often by disrupting the way cells function. The more mutations a cell acquires, the more likely it is to turn cancerous.\nThe reason why some people can smoke for years without getting cancer, while others develop the disease, is down to the way mutations arise. When a person smokes, the chemicals they inhale create mutations at random points in the genome. Many of these changes will be harmless, but others not so benign. The more smoke a person is exposed to, the greater the chance that the accumulating mutations will hit specific spots in the DNA that turn cells cancerous.\n\u201cYou can really think of it as playing Russian roulette,\u201d said Ludmil Alexandrov, a theoretical biologist at Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico and the first author of the study. \u201cYou can miss the right genes. But if you smoke you still play the game. It\u2019s a very strong message for people not to start smoking. If you smoke even a little bit you\u2019ll erode the genetic material of most of the cells in your body.\u201d Smoking is the most preventable cause of cancer in the world and accounts for more than 1 in 4 UK cancer deaths.\nWith researchers at the Wellcome Trust\u2019s Sanger Institute near Cambridge and others, Alexandrov analysed the DNA of more than 5,000 cancers. The team then turned to pattern recognition software to tease apart the various mutational signatures found in tumours from smokers versus non-smokers. To find the signatures - the patterns of mutations present in cancer cells - researchers performed the genetic equivalent of recording the chatter at a party and then extracting individual conversations from the hubbub.\nThe scientists spotted more than 20 mutational signatures in 13 types of cancer linked to tobacco smoking. But only five of these were more common in smokers\u2019 tumours. One pattern of mutations, dubbed signature four, was found to be a major driver for lung cancer. It is thought to be caused by benzopyrene, a chemical found in tobacco smoke.\nMore intriguing was how tobacco caused mutations in tissues that are not directly exposed to smoke, such as the bladder, kidneys and pancreas. The study found that chemicals from tobacco smoke found their way to different organs and tissues and then sped up the molecular clocks in the cells. This ramped up the natural rate at which mutations built up in the tissues.\n\u201cWe knew there was direct damage from smoking in the lungs. What we didn\u2019t expect was to see smoking speed up the molecular clocks inside cells,\u201d said Alexandrov, whose study appears in the journal Science. \u201cIn bladder cancer, the only thing that causes the extra mutations in smokers is the speeding up of the clock, and that will be very dependent on the intensity of smoking. For every pack of cigarettes you smoke per year, you accumulate 18 mutations in all of your bladder cells,\u201d he added.\nScientists hope that by understanding how the individual ingredients of tobacco smoke raise the risk of various cancers, they can develop new ways to prevent the disease. The same techniques used in the latest study will now be used to tease apart how alcohol, obesity and other factors also increase a person\u2019s cancer risk.\n\u201cThere is a message here for people who are occasional or social smokers who think it doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Alexandrov. \u201cIf you smoke four to five packs of cigarettes in your lifetime it doesn\u2019t sound that much, but you still get several mutations in every cell in your lungs and these are permanent, they do not go away. There are a lot of things that do revert back when you stop smoking, and this shouldn\u2019t discourage people from giving up, but the specific mutations in the lung cells are like scars. If you stop smoking, they\u2019ll still be there.\u201d\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Major investigation into root causes of cancer reveals how tobacco smoke mutates DNA and gives rise to more than a dozen types of tumour", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/03/dna-study-lays-bare-devastating-damage-caused-by-smoking", "title": "DNA study lays bare devastating damage caused by smoking"}, "165": {"text": "A high court judgment in which the current England assistant manager, Sammy Lee, was found to have knowingly given false evidence has been upheld by the court of appeal. Lee, when manager of Bolton Wanderers for a short period in 2007 having taken over from Sam Allardyce, was found to have lied about his club\u2019s involvement in signing the midfield player Gavin McCann, who had been poached by the agents SEM.\nThe Football Association has never taken any action against anybody involved in the case, despite findings revealing that Bolton and SEM then backdated the contract for McCann, and that Lee and other witnesses gave false evidence. Following the upholding of the judgment\u2019s findings on appeal, the FA declined to comment.\nTony McGill, the agent who had an agreement with McCann to represent the player, succeeded in September 2014 with his accusation that SEM, whose then chief executive was the well-known agent Jerome Anderson, had poached McCann at the last minute with the Bolton deal already agreed. Bolton paid SEM a \u00a3300,000 fee for doing \u201clittle or nothing,\u201d the judgment stated. Lee and Frank McParland, Bolton\u2019s then general manager, were found to have lied about two meetings they claimed had taken place with McCann in a restaurant in Liverpool, designed to show that they had discussed McCann with SEM earlier than they did.\nHis honour Judge Waksman QC, in his 2014 judgment, said he did not accept that any such meetings took place and stated of Lee\u2019s, Bolton\u2019s and SEM\u2019s evidence: \u201cTheir accounts do not stack up and are riddled with inconsistencies and different versions over time.\u201d\nIn a later ruling on legal costs Waksman recorded that Lee\u2019s and McParland\u2019s evidence about the meetings was \u201cunreliable\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d, saying: \u201cThe events attested to by the Bolton witnesses concerning these meetings simply did not happen. True, I did not use the word \u2018dishonesty\u2019 [in his first judgment] but plainly, if their evidence on the facts on this issue was false, they must have known it to be so.\u201d\nWaksman also found that Bolton, then chaired by the late Phil Gartside, an FA board member, backdated the contract signed by McCann, to make it look as if SEM had been involved earlier than they were. The judge found that Gartside\u2019s evidence was also unreliable and said he \u201cbecame visibly uncomfortable\u201d under questioning about the contract, before finally admitting that he signed it at a later date than the one written on the contract.\nBolton and SEM presented their commercial relationship as if SEM had acted for the club and not McCann, who was said to have resented paying tax when an agent\u2019s fee was paid on his behalf by a club. This practice, of stating that an agent was acting for a club and not a player, was known as \u201cswitching.\u201d Bolton, though, did record the \u00a3300,000 fee paid to SEM as a benefit for McCann anyway, the court was told, because Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs were conducting \u201can increasing number of investigations\u201d into football transfers.\nWaksman found that when McCann called McGill to tell him SEM were going to do the deal with Bolton, McGill had said: \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Gavin, we have an agreement, what about that?\u201d McCann had replied: \u201cI am sorry, I feel shit\u201d.\nMcGill complained first to the Football Association in 2007, even before McCann signed for Bolton, that SEM had poached McCann from him, in breach of an oral agreement they had made for McGill to represent the player, but the FA took no action and he began court proceedings. Despite Waksman\u2019s findings of poaching, false evidence given by several senior football figures including Sammy Lee and the backdating of the contract, the FA still took no action in 2014. Waksman ruled that despite his findings about the conduct of the Bolton and SEM defendants, McGill could not in fact receive any damages, because he did not have a written agreement with McCann so could not prove he definitely would have ultimately concluded the Bolton deal for him.\nMcGill appealed, and two court of appeal judges have now ruled that in fact he was the victim of an \u201cunlawful means conspiracy\u201d and should be entitled to damages for having lost the opportunity to conclude the deal for McCann to sign for Bolton. That issue, of how much damages McGill is entitled to from SEM, has been referred back to Waksman to be decided.\nThe appeal court judges, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Henderson, upheld all the factual findings made by Waksman in his 2014 judgment, noting that although he did not grant McGill\u2019s claim for damages: \u201cThe judge was very critical, however, of much of the evidence given by the defendants and their witnesses, and he concluded that they had fabricated some key events in a misguided attempt to improve their position.\u201d\nMcGill, who has spent nine years fighting to prove his case, told the Guardian that he informed the FA in May 2007 just after McCann was poached away from him, and had always kept the governing body informed.\n\u201cThey now know Bolton submitted a false and backdated contract, that Sammy Lee and Frank McParland gave evidence in court the judge dismissed as untrue, but the FA have done nothing,\u201d he said.\nLee, the former Liverpool and England midfielder, left Bolton in October 2007, then worked in senior coaching roles at Liverpool, back at Bolton and Southampton, before the FA appointed him to rejoin Allardyce, as the England team\u2019s assistant manager, in July this year.\nAfter Allardyce, after taking charge of just one game, left by mutual consent following the undercover sting by the Daily Telegraph last month, Lee has been retained, and is currently working with the squad preparing for the forthcoming matches against Scotland and Spain.\nAsked if following the appeal the FA would now be taking action against Lee or any of the other defendants in the McGill case, a spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand there are still matters to be decided by the court and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment\u201d.\n", "tags": ["sport"], "abstract": "A high court judgment in which the current England assistant manager, Sammy Lee, was found to have knowingly given false evidence has been upheld by the court of appeal", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/07/england-sammy-lee-bolton-transfer-deal-appeal-court", "title": "Appeal court finds Sammy Lee gave false evidence over Bolton transfer deal"}, "166": {"text": "Jon Jones, the UFC\u2019s interim light heavyweight champion, and one of the organization\u2019s biggest draws, has been given a one-year suspension by the US Anti-Doping Agency.\nThe 29 year-old had entered arbitration with Usada last month over an out of competition test in June.

We\u2019re only a small place.\n\u201cIt was a tough final and with the amount of pressure Ding is under, from China alone, but to play like that \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how he could do that.\n\u201cIn the first to 18 a 6-0 lead is not a huge one, especially against someone like Ding. He played fantastically earlier today and I had to just hang on to him. I\u2019m just over the moon. I saved my best performance for the final and I only had two good sessions in the tournament. Luckily my \u2018B\u2019 game is pretty good.\u201d\nRob Walker, snooker\u2019s wonderfully energetic and comic MC, who appears to have walked straight off the pages of the Pickwick Papers, has nicknames for all the players.\nSome work well, others less so. But when Walker introduces Selby as \u201cThe Jester from Leicester\u201d it is as if his humour has taken a decidedly ironic turn. Steve Davis was closer to the mark when, referring to Selby\u2019s Sunday evening vigil, he described him as \u201cthe night porter from hell\u201d. Selby is also, according to his old mentor Willie Thorne, \u201cthe most dedicated snooker player I have ever seen\u201d.\nThere is a rare determination about him, which is hardy surprising in view of the fact his mother walked out of the family home when he was only eight. He and his brother were brought up unaided by their father, who died when Mark was 16.\nThe influence of Ding\u2019s father was hardly any less relevant. When he was eight years old he took \u201cLittle Ding\u201d with him to a local snooker hall and, when his father went to the toilet, he returned to find his baby-faced son had taken over his cue and won the match for him.\nWhile another memorable final was being played out, the World Snooker chairman, Barry Hearn, celebrated a \u201cboom time for the sport\u201d, announcing a two-year extension to the sport\u2019s contract with the BBC, which will run until 2019, while announcing the world championship will remain in Sheffield until 2027.\nHearn said: \u201cThe BBC have gone the extra mile for us. They have had their licence fee frozen by HM Government. It\u2019s cut their arms off, in terms of competing with the pay broadcasters, but compete they did.\n\u201cThe BBC are struggling financially. But they have really got behind snooker. We have had 20 extra hours of additional coverage this year. That\u2019s good because it shows that once they have bought something they really make the most of it, instead of hiding it in the schedules. Now I can\u2019t wait to see the numbers coming in from China.\u201d\nIt was another memorable final \u2013 particularly when the form of these players this season is considered. Ding, ranked 17, had to qualify for this championship.\n", "tags": ["sport"], "abstract": "Leicester\u2019s Mark Selby beat China\u2019s Ding Junhui 18-14 to win his second World Championship at The Crucible", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/02/mark-selby-world-championshp-ding-junhui", "title": "Mark Selby clinches second world title with 18-14 win over Ding Junhui"}, "170": {"text": "The internet of shopping is finally here: magic-like buttons that when pressed have goods delivered to your door, without any need to log on to a website or get out your credit card. The branded Dash buttons are Amazon\u2019s latest offering to make it easier to shop, so I bought a load of them to find out whether it\u2019s the retail revolution we didn\u2019t even know we were looking for.\nThere is no Dash button for ordering Dash buttons, so I looked though the 40 or so available and found eight for things I would normally buy. They\u2019re \u00a35 each, so I spent \u00a340 for this convenience, but with the promise \u00a35 would be taken off the first purchase made with each button making them free in the long run.\nA box of boxes turned up the next day. Each Dash button comes in a small cardboard box. Unpacking them and setting them up was straightforward if a little tedious. For each one you have to do a little song and dance with the Amazon app.\nSelect the option to set up a new Dash, tell it the password to your Wi-Fi network, select the product and quantity and then hit save. The delivery and payment information is pulled from your Amazon one-click order settings; there\u2019s no way to set per-item delivery locations.\nIt doesn\u2019t take too long to set one up, but doing eight in one go got old really fast. Once activated though, that\u2019s you done. In future all you have to do is hit the button \u2013 although that proved to be too easy.\nThankfully when you have pushed the button you get until evening that day to cancel the order. When you\u2019ve made an order a notification pops up from the Amazon app on the device you set up the Dash buttons with, but you can and probably should activate that notification on every device you own.\nThe first time the notification saved my bacon was when I installed the Dash buttons. They come with a sticky strip on the back and a small black hanging bracket that you can attach to a hook or similar. I chose to stick them in place out the way, next to where I\u2019d normally store whatever it was. In the bathroom cabinet for toothbrush heads and Listerine, under the sink for bin bags, cleaning fluid, that kind of thing.\nBy the time I\u2019d managed to stick them in place I\u2019d already ordered a set of new toothbrush heads by accident, and very nearly some toilet roll and washing tablets, none of which I needed. A couple of taps in the app and the order was cancelled.\nI felt good about the installation. They were stuck out the way, inconspicuous and convenient and everything was fine. That was, until they started ordering stuff on their own. It turns out that the adhesive on the back of the Dash buttons doesn\u2019t like sticking to unpainted MDF surfaces within cupboards.\nThe one I had stuck next to the stocks of shower gel, moisturiser and other bits fell off almost immediately within the cupboard, landing as it fell to the shelf surface below on an upstanding bottle of nail varnish ordering some foundation in the process. The first I knew of it was an order notification.\nPresuming it was my fault I simply stuck it back in place with a bit more gusto, which lasted for about an hour before another ping and another tube of foundation to be cancelled. This was starting to get tedious.\nThe Rimmel button was just the start of a trend. Over the next few days all but two of the buttons dropped off various metal, paint and wooden surfaces, some ordering products, others just making a nasty clang in the middle of the night and waking me up.\nIn the end I took the nuclear option and stripped the adhesive gel off the back of the Dash buttons, which doesn\u2019t take long if you pull hard enough, and replaced them with poster mounting strips, which did the trick.\nOnce finally, safely attached to the walls it was a couple of weeks before I actually pushed any of the buttons on purpose. Then the toilet roll and mouthwash began to run out, so it was finally time to put them into action.\nPressing the button was simple. Getting the delivery, however, was not. The trouble is that when setting up the toilet roll button the only option was for an order of 45 rolls. Normally I\u2019d buy eight at a time; our family doesn\u2019t go through toilet paper that quickly.\nIn order to receive a package the size of 45 rolls I had to order it the day before I knew I would be at home to receive it. So I got up on Friday morning, hit both the Andrex and Listerine buttons and gleefully waited for them arrive on Saturday, my very first internet of things purchases.\nThat\u2019s when the second round of trouble started. When I hit the button we were down to three rolls. But while the 1L of mouthwash arrived on Saturday as expected \u2013 in a big box, of course \u2013 the toilet roll did not. By Sunday morning with two toilet rolls left, the order was still \u201cpreparing for dispatch\u201d so I hit cancel, consoling myself that at least Tesco would provide.\nUnfortunately Amazon said I couldn\u2019t cancel because it was already on its way, but on Monday it was still \u201cdispatching\u201d, so I tried cancelling again, to no avail. By Monday evening we were already a good chunk into our last toilet roll, with visions of having to resort to kitchen roll or yesterday\u2019s Guardian. To make matters worse I was off on holiday on Wednesday and was starting to have visions of 45 toilet rolls stuck outside my front door like a giant advert to burglars.\nThankfully it arrived sometime on Tuesday. I came home to find it wedged behind a bin \u2013 luckily it didn\u2019t rain \u2013 meaning we\u2019ll be stocked until February at least. It was not the best first order experience. Subsequent orders for toothbrush heads, Dettol, dishwasher tablets were less painful, primarily because I got most of them delivered when one of the family was home for some other reason. But it certainly wasn\u2019t a case of simply hit it and forget it. \nYou can get deliveries sent to an Amazon locker if there are any within striking distance, but not everything can fit in one - there\u2019s no way the toilet rolls would have. And by the time you\u2019ve gone out to a locker to pick up some Listerine you might just as well have gone to the supermarket. \nWashing tablets, like toilet roll, presented a scale problem. While the tablets arrived on time, they arrived in serious quantity: 180 tabs across six boxes, which at a rate of about one or two a week, is going to last me at least 18 months and feels like I\u2019ve turned my house into a warehouse full of them. The Rimmel button, for a product that would fit through the letter box, has still never been intentionally pressed.\nAmazon pitched the Dash buttons as a way of avoiding the need to fill up your house with large stocks of the boring things in life, but when the order quantities are vast, the next day delivery fails or you simply don\u2019t have someone there everyday to receive deliveries, they\u2019re more trouble than they\u2019re worth.\nPerhaps if you\u2019re part of the metropolitan elite and your serviced apartment comes with a concierge, or you work from home or someone is always in, the brain-free push of the Dash button is a great idea. But the convenience of pushing a button is outweighed by the hassle for me.\nI\u2019ll be keeping some of them for smaller items - they are great for toothbrush heads and bin liners \u2013 and getting them delivered to work but the Andrex button and any others for heavy goods are going: it\u2019s just easier to go to a supermarket and pick them up, or order them in a big weekly online grocery shop.\nThe novelty of Amazon dash buttons wore off even faster than the adhesive backing. \n", "tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "Doing your shopping by pressing buttons in your home sounds like a great labour-saving life-hack \u2026 and then you get 45 toilet rolls arrive in one go", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/07/hopping-amazon-dash-buttons-", "title": "I tried to do my shopping with Amazon Dash buttons so you don't have to"}, "171": {"text": "When Emojipedia founder Jeremy Burge sent his fiancee to the wrong side of London for dinner, he sent an apologetic text message. He received an emoji-less reply: \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cWe all know that\u2019s not what it means at all. That means \u2018it\u2019s not fine\u2019,\u201d he said, pointing out that emoji have infiltrated language so deeply that their absence from that message carries a meaning that we all understand. Once considered a nerd topic, emoji have now become a mainstream medium, Burge says \u2013 and San Francisco\u2019s first Emojicon conference seems to agree.\nHundreds of adults (and surprisingly few children) turned up for sessions including Emoji Karaoke, where participants had to translate the lyrics of pop songs such as Call Me Maybe into strings of emoji; emoji spellcasting, which revealed how modern witches have embraced technology; and a specialist emoji balloon artist whose biggest request was the poop symbol. There was even a stall selling Emojibator, a vibrator in the shape of the aubergine/eggplant emoji. Something for everyone.\nEmoji users feel a significant ownership over these tiny digital symbols, as evidenced by the reaction when Apple swapped the gun emoji for a water pistol and changed the peach emoji to look less like a butt, or when a Saudi teen designed her own headscarf-wearing emoji.\nEmoji have also been recognized as art, with New York\u2019s Museum of Mordern Art (MoMA) acquiring the original 176 emoji designed by a Japanese phone company in 1999. Not everyone agrees with putting emoji on this lofty cultural pedestal, said Paul Galloway, MoMA\u2019s architecture and design collection specialist, but there was similar pushback when MoMA introduced photography, cubist artworks and video games to its collection. \n\u201cPeople think we should be sticking to beautiful oil paintings by dead European guys, but this is part of a broader range of creativity,\u201d he said.\nYet there are more serious cultural problems highlighted by the rise of emoji, particularly how to make them more inclusive to people of different races, genders and physical abilities. Until a range of skintones were introduced for emoji in 2015, there were no options for making emoji anything other than white (or cartoon yellow) \u2013 and even the new set of modifiers were only introduced after public outrage about lack of diversity.\nResearcher Kate Miltner has spent two years researching why emoji were developed with such a limited worldview. She concluded that there was no intention to actively exclude people, but that the icons did align with a belief that inadvertently marginalizes people \u2013 the belief that technology is neutral.\n\u201cEmoji may seem trivial, just silly little faces, but when you aren\u2019t represented by something that\u2019s so widely used, it\u2019s a problem. The values either intentionally \u2013 or unintentionally \u2013 baked into the systems we use on a daily basis can deeply impact people and how they navigate their world,\u201d said Miltner, a PhD student at USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, who conducted extensive interviews with, and analyzed hundreds of emails from, the Unicode Consortium, the official body which standardizes emoji.\nBoth Unicode and its partner, the International Organization for Standardization, approached their task as a technical process, Miltner said, to encode the characters originally created by Japanese telecoms firms and avoid \u201cthe messy politics of representation\u201d. Yet there is no such thing as a neutral or apolitical technological system.\n\u201cDesign and engineering choices are made by people \u2013 people who have belief systems, who work for organizations that have belief systems, and who direct their products to a market or a set of consumers who have certain belief systems,\u201d said Miltner. \u201cThis is not necessarily bad \u2013 it\u2019s just how things are.\u201d\n\u201cInvesting in the idea that technology is neutral ignores and even erases the influence of engineers, designers and the organizations they work for. When this happens, it often works out that marginalized groups \u2013 people of color, LGBTQIA folks, differently abled people \u2013 are not taken into consideration because they are not considered to be the default, or the norm.\u201d\nThe author Toni Morrison once said: \u201cIn this country, \u2018American\u2019 means white. Everybody else has to hyphenate.\u201d Hosiery, clothing and bandages sold as \u201cskin tone\u201d are typically the colour of white skin, Miltner said, because whiteness is considered the default skin in the western world. The same happens with gender and sexual orientation; until 2015 the family emoji represented a heterosexual, white-skinned couple with two children. \u201cWhen people say default or standard that usually means western, white and usually male,\u201d she said.\nMiltner says we need to think beyond binary interpretations of gender and race, especially in technologies that \u2013 however \u201ccute\u201d or \u201csilly\u201d \u2013 are used by millions of people worldwide. \n\u201cIt behooves us all to acknowledge the power and politics that are involved in the formation of widely used technologies, especially if we are to move beyond the \u2018default\u2019 and towards more inclusivity.\u201d\n", "tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "As fans gather for San Francisco\u2019s first Emojicon, a researcher explains how your phone\u2019s keyboard reveals \u2018baked-in\u2019 values beyond poop and eggplants", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/07/emoji-diversity-texting-emojicon-san-francisco", "title": "Emoji diversity: how 'silly little faces' can make a big difference"}, "172": {"text": "Samsung has taken out a full-page advert in multiple US newspapers to apologise for the faulty Note 7 phone, which has now been subject to a worldwide recall.\nThe advert in Monday\u2019s Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post, is signed by Samsung\u2019s North America chief executive, Gregory Lee.

In between precision shots from his Ghostbusters-like energy weapon, he grapples on to a grunt and pulls the pin on his grenade before kicking him towards two buddies, who look on helplessly as he greets them with an explosion. That taken care of, Reyes grapples to his waiting Jackal space fighter and boosts off to begin dogfighting with enemy craft. \nNeedless to say, Call of Duty\u2019s production values ensure such episodes look spectacular. They may not be perfect in execution \u2013 rotation can become disorientating and enemy AI remains erratic \u2013 but they at least attempt to jolt this long-running series off its sometimes derided rails. Disappointingly though, Infinity Ward\u2019s latest offering is mostly the familiar CoD routine of boots-on-the-ground combat in long corridors of choreographed action. It\u2019s just that here, those boots are rocket-boosted and wall-run-capable. Even this concept is a pale imitation of Titanfall at its finest, boasting similar fundamentals but not the conviction to make them integral. While traversing these familiar sci-fi environments \u2013 futuristic cityscape, ice planet, rock planet, space station \u2013 parkour is mostly unnecessary.\nThe old problem of this game\u2019s key narrative delivery technique remains: you have to follow computer-controlled characters who yell orders and exposition at you, but often they move too slow and it gets frustrating \u2013 like attempting to navigate Oxford Street on a particularly chaotic festive shopping day. The sheer number of times the game strips control away from you remains extraordinary \u2013 after a while, even the most impressive cinematic moments become a deadening intrusion. The first time you\u2019re blasted out of an airlock it\u2019s inarguably impressive and it even feels appropriate that you\u2019re helpless. The second time is simply irritating. The third time, you just want to drift away forever like Frank Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. \nBut even in space, you lack freedom. Attempts to flank the enemy are thwarted by a curt prompt to return to the \u201ccombat zone\u201d or be booted. The space craft combat sequences are a mess. The physics lack heft and movement feels erratic. Opposing fighters are simple to lock on to but the game then wrests control away to track them. Occasionally, when you kill an enemy, a playing card will pop up to tell you he was a big cheese (in an imitation of the American ploy towards rogue Ba\u2019athists in 2003), but since you only find this out after killing them it renders the whole scheme somewhat pointless. You shot them just the same as all the others; that\u2019s all you do in CoD.\nMuch is made of the fact you\u2019re a captain but you can\u2019t issue orders in the field and, despite a Mass Effect-like galaxy map to navigate on your ship\u2019s bridge, you cannot shape the campaign\u2019s outcome. You can select two types of side-mission \u2013 ship-infiltration or ship-to-ship combat \u2013 but the benefit of them is merely upgraded equipment. It\u2019s certainly no Mass Effect in this respect \u2013 and while that comparison is harsh, it\u2019s conditioned by the developer\u2019s flagrant desire for you to care about your mission and crew; the message about prioritising one over the other crowbarred into every conversation.\nThe setting at least allows the game to sidestep CoD\u2019s traditionally problematic politics, even if the opening sneak-attack on Geneva subtly nods towards Pearl Harbour and 9/11. Not being offensive shouldn\u2019t be praiseworthy, however, and the Martian secessionists led by Salen Kotch (a space-scenery-chewing Kit Harington) are so comically evil, and your means for defeating them so silly, they undermine any questions about military service the game attempts to tackle.\nThe defeat of the villain is woefully anticlimactic, whereas the finale has dramatic deaths for minor crew members you\u2019d barely noticed hitherto. While the credits roll you can listen to letters from the fallen, meant to sum up the series\u2019 earnest move away from \u201cpress x to show respects\u201d miss-steps. Instead, they bring to mind the deliberately ridiculous barbecue dream of BJ Blazkowicz in the last Wolfenstein. The characters here lack the script to justify you caring. The damning irony is only wisecracking robot Ethan sounds remotely human.\nFor all these flaws, CoD\u2019s core shooting mechanics, refined over countless iterations, still make for a fine corridor and multiplayer shooter. Every weapon comes with alternative fire modes and being creative in your kills is part of the appeal. Innovations such as anti-grav grenades and spider bots (which scuttle over to enemies before discharging) spice things up, not least when they\u2019re deployed against you. One of the most enjoyable new tactics in the campaign is the ability to take direct control of enemy bots by hacking them, unleashing rounds on their bewildered allies before detonating to take as many with you as you can.\nAfter completing the game, you can replay the whole thing in modes like Yolo, which offers a challenging permadeath mechanic that encourages a whole different approach (ie a lot of hiding).\nThe online multiplayer modes are the best thing. The campaign\u2019s traversal mechanics come out of hiding and the wealth of options become apparent. Whether you\u2019re angling for nuts and bolts deathmatch on a lunch break, or something more substantial, CoD remains a silly, slick and intuitive shooter that sucks you in and keeps you there. The ready-built combat rigs cater to different play styles so you can instantly pick the right loadout, whether you like to snipe or stab.\nFor the first time there\u2019s weapon crafting, too, and a conscious effort to reward players for attempting different match-types, not to mention a neat 1980s theme park reboot of zombie survival. Prototype weapons are the strongest in the game \u2013 graded common to epic \u2013 and you obtain them by earning salvage as you play or completing challenges with one of four mission teams. The holy grail is a gun that provides a nuclear blast if you can string together 25 kills.\nCrucially, such objectives are optional and there\u2019s no chance of the camera being yanked-away as you complete them. Infinite Warfare improves online because the game doesn\u2019t dictate your experiences precisely as the developers intended. In many ways the campaign feels like a wrestling match between your game and theirs, perhaps a mirroring of their attempt to innovate within the constraints of the CoD franchise behemoth. But this doesn\u2019t excuse a forgettable plot or inferior fighting to its triple-A peers. Infinite Warfare could have been much more than a passable single-player movie attached to a super fast, super confident multiplayer infrastructure.

One customer described the new bar as looking \u201clike a weird knock-off of itself\u201d.\nExplaining the change, the statement on Toblerone\u2019s Facebook page said: \u201cLike many other companies, we are experiencing higher costs for numerous ingredients. \n\u201cWe carry these costs for as long as possible, but to ensure Toblerone remains \u2026 affordable and retains the triangular shape, we have had to reduce the weight of just two of our bars in the UK, from the wider range of available Toblerone products.\u201d\nCustomers replying to the post have been scathing.

He tweeted:\nA spokeswoman for Mondel\u0113z International, the US food and drink corporation that owns the Toblerone brand, said the price rise was not related to Brexit. However, it comes after a number of companies sought to raise prices to offset the effect of a plunging pound since the vote to leave the EU. \nOn Sunday, it emerged that Birds Eye fish fingers and Walkers crisps had joined Typhoo and Unilever, the owner of Marmite, and a number of smaller suppliers in an industry-wide battle over price increases caused by the 14.5% drop in the value of the pound against the euro and 18% against the dollar since the referendum.\nToblerone was created in 1908 by Theodor Tobler, a second-generation chocolatier from Bern, Switzerland, in collaboration with his cousin Emil Baumann. Its name is a portmanteau of the creator\u2019s surname and \u201ctorrone\u201d, the Italian word for honey and almond nougat. \nToblerone\u2019s own website proudly tells how the following year it became the first milk chocolate bar with almonds and honey to be protected by intellectual property laws after Tobler successfully applied for a patent to cover its manufacturing process. \nWhile many believe that the bar\u2019s shape is meant to evoke the Swiss Alps, a belief no doubt perpetuated by the image of the Matterhorn on its packaging, this is said to be a myth. Years later, Tobler\u2019s sons claimed that their father got his inspiration from the dancers of Paris\u2019s Folies Berg\u00e8res, who formed a pyramid at the climax of their show. \n", "tags": ["business"], "abstract": "Chocolate lovers blast \u2018plain dumb\u2019 cost-saving move to widen spaces between bar\u2019s triangular chunks", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/toblerone-gets-more-gappy-but-its-fans-are-not-happy", "title": "Toblerone gets more gappy, but its fans are not happy"}, "176": {"text": "Royal Bank of Scotland has apologised to small business customers as it revealed a \u00a3400m bill to compensate them for poor treatment in the wake of the banking crisis.\nAfter at least three years of complaining of bad service from the bailed-out bank, small businesses will receive refunds of the fees they were charged and will be allowed to make fresh complaints about their treatment between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge.\nRoss McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: \u201cWe have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made. Some of our customers went through what was a traumatic and painful experience as a result of the crisis. I am very sorry that we did not provide the level of service and understanding we should have done.\u201d\nA review is under way into whether bonuses should be withheld from former and current staff involved in the bank\u2019s now now-defunct global restructuring group (GRG), which is at the heart of the complaints.\nThe allegations first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits.\nSome 12,000 small businesses were forced into GRG but only 4,000 will automatically receive a refund of \u201ccomplex\u201d fee. In total, some 8,000 were potentially viable when they entered GRG, while 4,000 were facing insolvency.\nConfirmation of the compensation plans \u2013 details of which began to emerge on Monday \u2013 immediately sparked concerns that the sum being aside by the 73% taxpayer-owned bank was inadequate. \n\u201cGiven the damage to the lives of RBS\u2019s customers, \u00a3400m is wholly inadequate and is a cynical attempt to evade accounting fully for the consequences of RBS GRG\u2019s action. We are disgusted by this proposal,\u201d said David Stewart, of the RBS GRG Business Action Group, which has more than 500 members demanding \u00a32bn in compensation.

But it also concluded that there was evidence of systemically poor treatment of small business customers.\nBailey signalled that further delays to the report \u2013 commissioned from legal experts Promontory and Mazars \u2013 were likely as it would have to undergo Maxwellisation, where anyone facing criticism is allowed to comment, before publication. \nThe FCA also cautioned that the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated. \u201cTherefore, the FCA\u2019s powers are limited in this area,\u201d the FCA said. However, it does not necessarily indicate the bank will escape financial sanction as the regulator said it was \u201ccurrently assessing what further work may be needed given the findings in the report\u201d.\nMcEwan has repeatedly defended the bank against claims that it deliberately tried to profit from small business customers and RBS repeated on Tuesday that it had lost more than \u00a32bn in lending to small businesses.\nHe said the situation could not be tackled until now \u2013 even though a report commissioned from Clifford Chance in 2014 had highlighted the issues of poorly structured fees \u2013 because the FCA review had been continuing.\nPromontory examined 207 cases and covered a six-year period, analysing 323 gigabytes of data \u2013 approximately 1.5m pages and 270,000 emails.\n", "tags": ["business"], "abstract": "Bank apologises for poor treatment during financial crisis and will automatically refund fees", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/rbs-facing-400m-bill-to-compensate-small-business-customers", "title": "RBS facing \u00a3400m bill to compensate small business customers"}, "177": {"text": "Sports Direct\u2019s board has said it did not know about or authorise an apparent attempt to secretly record a group of MPs who paid a surprise visit to its warehouse.\nSix MPs from the business select committee arrived at the site in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, on Monday after giving the company an hour\u2019s notice. They were accepting an invitation made by the founder and chief executive, Mike Ashley, when he appeared before the committee in June. \nAfter they were shown round, the MPs went to a meeting room where they claimed a small camera used to record the day\u2019s proceedings was placed under a tray of sandwiches.\nIn a statement to the stock exchange, Sports Direct\u2019s board said it had not been proved that the camera was to be used to record the MPs and complained that the episode had overshadowed good things that came from the visit.\nThe company added: \u201cThe board would like to make it clear that it did not authorise or have any knowledge of the possible recording device.\u201d\nSports Direct said it was delighted MPs had \u201cfinally accepted the company\u2019s invitation to visit the Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse on an unannounced basis\u201d but that the board was disappointed they chose a day when they knew Ashley would be away from Shirebrook. \nKaren Byers, global operations head and one of Ashley\u2019s closest associates, was understood to have shown the MPs round in Ashley\u2019s absence.\nAshley invited the MPs to Shirebrook after the Guardian\u2019s investigation exposed how Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the minimum wage. The business committee subsequently accused Ashley of running the business like a Victorian workhouse in a report published in July.\nThe board, led by embattled chairman Keith Hellawell, said it understood the MPs met many staff members who were positive about the company and that employees expressed unhappiness about how the company had been portrayed. \nAshley said: \u201cI stand firmly behind the people of Sports Direct, who through no fault of their own have been made a political football by MPs and unions.\u201d\nAnna Turley, one of the MPs who visited Shirebrook, said they were made to feel unwelcome and were taken on a \u201cwild goose chase\u201d around the vast site before being shown the warehouse at the centre of the row about working practices.\nTurley told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect them to be overjoyed when we were there but would say: \u2018This is the same as any other day.

He outlined plans to open 200 new Simply Food outlets. \nM&S refused to identify which 30 \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homewares and food \u2013 are to close or identify the 45 outlets that will be converted into food stores. The chain has 304 full-line stores and the closures and conversions will take five years to complete.\nThe retailer is also looking to relocate underperforming stores. Overall, the changes will mean a reduction of 10% in the floorspace devoted to racks of skirts, jumpers and trousers, with the plan expected to cost \u00a3150m over three years.\nThe turnaround plan outlined by Rowe also includes the closure of 53 loss-making overseas stores in 10 countries. They include 10 stores in China, seven in France and others in Belgium and Hungary, resulting in 2,100 job losses. Only company-owned stores in Ireland, Hong Kong and the Czech Republic will be spared.\nThe embattled retailer intends to put clothing and food on an equal footing with same amount of selling space devoted to both sides of the business. Currently two-thirds of its floor space is given over to racks of clothing and homewares. \nRowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&S\u2019s Croydon store in south London and took over as chief executive six months ago, insisted the decision to close stores and reduce the space given over to clothing was not an admission of defeat.\n\u201cThis is not about cutting jobs, it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019ve got the right estate for future shopping habits,\u201d he said. \nEarlier this year, he announced 500 job cuts at the group\u2019s head office in London and a plan to shift another 400 jobs out of the capital.\nThe M&S veteran is seeking to revive the fortunes of the 132-year-old retailer which has seen profits go backwards in recent years. His biggest job is stopping the rot in its clothing business which has now in its fifth consecutive year of falling sales. M&S believes the growth of online fashion shopping means it can devote more store space to food without losing sales. About 17% of M&S\u2019s clothing sales are currently made online, a figure that is expected to grow.\nRowe is also axing the chain\u2019s Indigo, Collezione and North Coast labels to focus on brands that are \u201cmost relevant to our customers\u201d including Autograph, Per Una and Blue Harbour.\n\u201cThese are tough decisions, but vital to building a future M&S that is simpler, more relevant, multichannel and focused on delivering sustainable returns,\u201d said Rowe.\nThe plan was not well received by investors; shares finished the day as the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 \u2013 down more than 5% as analysts complained that Rowe\u2019s plan to revive M&S was not radical enough. \u201cBeing such a large company, it is going to take some time to turn M&S round even if all goes according to plan,\u201d said Haitong analyst Tony Shiret. \u201cWe think that it should have gone further in its UK clothing space closure.\u201d\nM&S\u2019s decision to retreat from the high street will be a blow for some towns, where it is a main destination store, especially following the demise of BHS. But as more purchases are made online, stores in smaller or less attractive town centres and shopping centres are finding life difficult.\n\u201cThe closure of the local M&S will have a psychological effect and feel like another nail in the coffin for that town\u2019s high street,\u201d said Local Data Company analyst Matthew Hopkinson. Hopkinson points to places such as Swindon and Stockton-on-Tees where shoppers have been drawn away from the high street by out-of-town retail parks.\nM&S has been battered by low-cost rivals such as H&M, Zara and Primark and shoppers are increasingly spending their spare cash on leisure activities, rather than buying new clothes. The turnaround plan was unveiled as the retailer reported a 19% fall in underlying profits to \u00a3231m in the six months to 1 October.\nTo win back shoppers, Rowe has already cut clothing prices and promised to pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers \u2013 fiftysomething women he has dubbed \u201cMrs M&S\u201d. He said changes he had already made in the clothing business were going down well. \u201cThe initial feedback we\u2019ve had from customers has been good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve improved the fit on many garments and, for the first time in a number of years, we\u2019ve grown full-price market share.\u201d\nRowe has promised a less slavish pursuit of catwalk trends after being criticised for failing to meet the needs of its middle-aged customer base. \nHis new strategy is an about turn from that of his predecessor Marc Bolland, who believed the retailer could be a global brand and reopened stores in France after a decade-long absence.\n\u201cWe have made mistakes in the past and we are taking action to correct some of these,\u201d said Rowe, who revealed M&S would continue to expand overseas using a franchise model. The mistakes are expensive ones \u2013 it will cost up to \u00a3200m to shut loss-making stores in European markets such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands as well as outposts in China.\n\n\n\n\n", "tags": ["economy"], "abstract": "Boss says revamp affects 25% of UK floorspace with more emphasis on food, and will also shut 53 overseas shops", "site": "guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/m-and-s-marks-spencer-close-80-stores-major-overhaul", "title": "M&S to close 30 UK stores and cut back on clothing"}, "179": {"text": "The cyber heist at Tesco Bank been described by the chief executive of the City regulator as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d incident in the UK.\nAndrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that \u201cthere are elements of this that look unprecedented and it is serious, clearly\u201d.\nTesco Bank stopped all online transactions for 140,000 current account customers on Monday after it discovered 40,000 customers had been targeted by the online attack. Half of the customers had money taken from their accounts, which are operated through an app or online.

Conservative MP Chris Philp, a member of the Treasury select committee, has raised the idea it could have been the work of a foreign power. \u201cI think we can\u2019t rule out the possibility, at all, that this is state-sponsored,\u201d he told the BBC earlier this week.\nAs the crisis was unfolding, Benny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, had said the decision to suspend some banking activities was an attempt to protect customers from \u201conline criminal activity\u201d.\nHiggins, who has apologised to customers, has described the raid as \u201ca systematic, sophisticated attack\u201d.\nThe NCSC said its role was to provide support to the investigation, work with the company concerned to manage the incident, investigate the root causes and use any lessons learned to provide future guidance and policy on cyber security.\nThe Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is also scrutinising the situation. It fined telecom company TalkTalk a record \u00a3400,000 in October for failing to stop the personal data of 157,000 customers being hacked. \nAndrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said after the hearing that \u201cthe attack on Tesco\u2019s retail accounts is deeply troubling.

One of the most walkable, flattest shoes around is just as bad as super-high heels: ballet flats. Unlike heels, which put all the pressure on the balls of your feet, flats add extra pressure to your heel, without any arch support, according to podiatrist Hillary Brenner, DPM. Additionally, \"a heel will lead to stress on the outside of the knee,\" says Miguel Cunha, DPM, at Gotham Footcare. \"A flat will lead to stress on the inside of the knee.\" \nStilettos, Higher Than 2 Inches Dr. Brenner: 9.75 Dr. Cunha: 9.5 \nNot all heels are created equal, obviously. There are plenty of factors to account for: stability, height, ankle support, etc. But if you're just looking at heel type and height, a stiletto with a heel higher than two inches is one of the worst shoes for your feet.  \nAny shoe higher than 4 inches got a 10 from Dr. Cunha, but even a 2.5-inch heel will severely disrupt your center of gravity. Extended wearing of these heels can cause pinched nerves and shortened tendons. Think about it: You're basically banging on the balls of your feet with every step. \nIf you do plan on wearing stilettos, both doctors recommend wearing them two to three hours max, and taking them off mid-day for a few exercises and stretches. \"You can draw the alphabet with your foot, or draw the number 8,\" Dr. Brenner recommends. \"Or you can take a tennis ball and roll your foot over that.\" Massage your arch to help your blood flow, which in turn helps prevent varicose veins or nerve irritation. Just remember: \"The higher the heel, the greater amount of pressure, and that will lead to issues in the bones,\" Dr. Cunha says.\nFlip-Flops Dr. Brenner: 10 Dr. Cunha: 9 \n\"Every time you take a step, your toes curl, and that leads to issues like hammertoes,\" Dr. Cunha says.\nBallet Flats Dr. Brenner: 9.75 Dr. Cunha: 8.5 \nFlats might feel like the comfiest shoes you've got, but \"[you] can be wearing comfy shoes, and they can be just as bad as heels,\" Dr. Brenner says. Without arch support or any sort of shock absorption for both the balls of your feet and the heels, people with flatter feet risk getting stress fractures and developing neuromas (enlargement of nerves between bones). For those with high arches? The shoes rank as a 7 for Dr. Cunha. But even then, the cut of a typical ballet flat could constrain your poor toes. \"When you're wearing pointy narrow shoes and not much support, the bones rub together,\" Dr. Brenner says. Not a fun \u2014 or comfortable \u2014 situation.\nBad Sneakers Dr. Brenner: 9 Dr. Cunha: 7 \nGranted, walking around in these all day is better than walking around in 5-inch heels; if you're just wearing them to brunch, Dr. Cunha rates them as a 4. But running, exercising, and doing anything more than walking in these? That's when the problems happen.\nMules Dr. Brenner: 8 Dr. Cunha: 6 \nMules are slightly deceiving: They look like a comfy, solid shoe, but the lack of ankle support makes them almost as bad as flip flops. \nThis goes for heeled mules, too. \"It's worse to have a heel that doesn't support the back of your feet,\" Dr. Cunha says. \" In addition to the extra weight on the front of your feet, you also have to curl your toes to make sure the shoe doesn't fall off to the side every time you plant your foot down.\" Heeled mules can leave you more susceptible to sprains, hammertoes, and bunions thanks to the constant flexing of your feet.\nGladiator Sandals Dr. Brenner: 7 Dr. Cunha: 6  \nThanks to the multiple ankle straps on gladiator sandals, these summer shoes are slightly better for your feet than mules and flip-flops \u2014 even when they're flat. Add a sturdy 1.5-inch heel, and you get a little more support with the style.  \nWhen buying heeled sandals, however, Dr. Brenner recommends taking a look at the arch support of the shoe. \"Yes, having a heel is great, but you still need that extra support below,\" Dr. Brenner says. \"If it has good arch support, then I would take it down to a 5 or a 6.\"\nStilettos, Lower Than 2 Inches Dr. Brenner: 7 Dr. Cunha: 5 \nAt less than 2 inches, the problem here isn't about the height: It's about the heel. \"In terms of stability, with a stiletto heel, you're more likely to develop an ankle sprain,\" Dr. Cunha says.  \nChunky Heel, Higher Than 2 Inches Dr. Brenner: 6 Dr. Cunha: 7.5 \nThese shoes get a slight pass thanks to their stable, squared-off heel. \"I'd say these are just two grades down from stilettos,\" Dr. Cunha says. \"You may not get an ankle sprain, but you're still putting all that pressure on the front of the foot.\"  \nJust remember: The higher a heel goes, the more pressure it puts on your feet \u2014 and the worse the shoes are. \"Anything above 4 inches, I would say, is an 8 or 9 here,\" Dr. Cunha says.\nChunky Heel, Lower Than 2 Inches Dr. Brenner: 4 Dr. Cunha: 4 \nAt two inches, chunky heels will still add extra stress to your knees and back.

With Hillary Clinton refusing to make a public concession speech and Donald Trump becoming the 45th President of the United States, we're left reeling in disbelief. We figured he'd deliver a speech targeting those who didn't vote for him but instead he delivered a painfully rehearsed speech that felt manipulative and downright dangerous. At least he did attempt to appeal to those who did not vote for him with a promise of unifying the country.\nFirst Mike Pence took to the podium looking like a sun baked idiot squinting in the glare of the non-existent sun. He was positively overcome with excitement (we're kidding, he looked like a robot straight out of Westworld) about his new position of Vice President of the United States. He didn't really say much other than, \"Let's make America great again.\" \nThen, the orange incarnate, AKA the 45th President of the United States, shuffled his way to the podium like some sort of sloth-like sexual predator. At 11:50 PST Trump took the stage to thank the American people. He started out by calling the election \"complicated business.\" On that, we can agree.\nTrump said Clinton has congratulated \"us\" on a hard fought campaign over the phone. He spent some time vaguely talking about Hillary and her service to the country, repeating the same words several times. He then pledged to the American people, something that was important to him: to be a good President to even those who didn't support him. He spoke of unifying the American population, and wanting to help even those who did not vote for him. This was a small consolation in a night of sorrows.\nThe whole thing was rather hard to watch when you can see the stock marketing hitting record lows directly beside Trump's podium and the sad boy who lingers at the right side of the stage like his prisoner. He made more vague promises about rebuilding the country, taking care of veterans, and \"tremendous\" security. \nAs Trump went on, he made sure to let us know his plan is to make America as great as his companies. He said he wanted our nation to dream big once again, and to seek common ground. It all felt incredibly forced and phony, mostly because of how calm he remained throughout the speech. A calm Trump is a scary Trump. \nHe proceeded to thank his bizarre family, listing them each by name. To be fair, they must have a lot of patience to deal with a man like Trump on a regular basis. The thanks continued on for a while, and even the human skeleton with eyes (and known idiot), Rudy Giuliani, made the lengthy list. \nHe treated the tail end of the speech like a dude-bro getting his diploma by naming off all the \"great men\" he knows. Every name was greeted by cheers from the crowd and at a certain point it didn't seem like the bragging would end. It really did go on for a long time, believe me. It went on big league. \nTrump did admit that in order to be truly \"historic, you have to do a great job.\" And this is the absolute truth. We don't believe it, not in the slightest, but dear lords above and below, do we hope we are dead wrong. His resolution to begin working immediately is worrisome, and while the two years of campaigning are over, he made it clear that with four, possibly eight years, the nightmare has only just begun.\n", "tags": ["opinion"], "abstract": "The 2016 Presidential Election certainly didn't go down the way we were expecting at the Outspeak office.

Usually, it\u2019s the work of a combination of hormonal changes and genetics, and it\u2019s far and away the most stubborn type of acne. Because it\u2019s so tough to treat, it requires a few different treatment methods. In addition to topical acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, you may want to consider oral antiobiotics to nix bacteria (which requires a trip to your doctor). A newer option worth trying? Probiotics. \u201cProbiotics have been shown to help cystic acne because they reduce inflammatory breakouts,\u201d says Kim Nichols, MD, a dermatologist in Greenwich, CT and consulting dermatologist for Avon.\nYou have: Small, red bumps that never come to a head.\nWhat\u2019s going on: Blame inflammation. A less-severe form of cystic acne, papular pustules are sensitive to the touch (from the inflammation) and also the work of hormones and genetics. On the bright side, this type of acne \u201crarely leads to permanent scarring like cystic acne can,\u201d says Nichols. She suggests using a mild exfoliant to keep the pores clean. One like BeautyRx Essential 8 percent Exfoliating Serum does the trick, but is still gentle enough to use every day.\nYou have: A pimple buried way beneath your skin.\nWhat\u2019s going on: Blind pimples are the worst, mostly because they can be incredibly painful. They\u2019re basically cystic acne that hasn\u2019t reached the surface of the skin. The good news, though, is that they often go away on their own \u2014 so you may feel the bump, but the chances of it actually emerging are pretty slim. (Don\u2019t even bother trying to squeeze it out. It\u2019ll only hurt like hell and could actually cause an infection beneath the skin.)\nYou have: A sprinkling of acne around your chin and jawline.\nWhat\u2019s going on: We\u2019re going to take a wild guess. Do those pimples usually appear around the same time every month? Breakouts around the lower half of the face are usually the work of fluctuating hormones. If you don\u2019t notice it lining up with your period, it could be a matter of hygiene. \u201cIt\u2019s rare, but the jawline and neck area are hard-to-reach areas and can be missed when you\u2019re cleansing,\u201d says Nichols. If you\u2019re double-cleanse on the daily, though, and know that it\u2019s not that, it\u2019s worth talking to your derm, since birth control can help level out those hormones. (Here\u2019s a guide to your options.)\nYou have: A regular whitehead.\nWhat\u2019s going on: Whiteheads (also known as comedones) are the classic zit case. They\u2019re essentially clogged pores caused by heavy oil production, which you\u2019re either born with or may be experiencing as a result of hormone fluctuations. The gunk that\u2019s clogged can trap bacteria into the pore, which leads to a mini-infection that brings about swelling, redness, and pain \u2014 AKA a pimple. \u201cA retinol cream, used a few nights per week, can minimize comedones,\u201d says Nichols, who recommends Avon Anew Clinical Line Eraser with Retinol Treatment.\nRelated: Dark Marks and Acne Scars: Your Complete Guide\nore from Teen Vogue:\nThe Top 10 Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making When You Straighten Your Hair\n27 Must-See Celebrity Prom Throwback Photos\nMore Than Half of What You Eat Isn\u2019t Even Real Food, Study Finds\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "For Teen Vogue, by Deanna Pal.  \n  \n Acne might be the great equalizer, plaguing everyone regardless of their grades, gender, or their taste in music....", "site": "huffington", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-treat-every-type-of-acne_us_58220617e4b044f827a79387", "title": "How To Treat Every Type Of Acne"}, "184": {"text": "\nMost of us are not aware of what we're communicating most of the time...\nOften we get a hint of how we come across thru conversation with others. Or if we're fortunate enough to have a best friend who means well, she will let us know if something is amiss. And when we do find out through an outside source (usually to our disgust!) it seems far from the ideal vision we have for ourselves. \nAnd when it comes to dating men, it could be that you just can't seem to keep a very attractive man interested in you. Why do you think that is? It could be a number of things you're unaware of. The tone of voice which is seeking validation and coming across as needy perhaps, the fashion faux-pas you're making through your outfit combination, or some sort of insecurity that reveals itself through your mannerisms. \nA \"style coach\" can come in and pinpoint some of the factors that are contributing to what is causing you angst, and steer you in a direction that can fix them somewhat. But more often than not a 'style' coach would only be concerned with your outward appearance, your way of dressing, the clothes you wear and how you combine your outfits.  \nKnow that fashion is only one part of style. You need a coach who goes beyond just fixing your 'style'. A self-image consultant will go beyond that and help you with your self-expression to help you achieve elegance, which is deeper and comes from within. Because once unattractive flaws and mannerisms are identified, you will have the power to change them. \nAnd as you develop your own unique style, you can start infusing elegance so that the total combination of both transforms the way you dress, the way you talk, behave, move your body, or do anything for that matter. Simply put, your inner and outer expressions start to match. Very soon, your thoughts, emotions, interests and values start aligning with your outer appearance and everything on the outside becomes a mere reflection of what's on the inside. \nYou see, it's not enough to just follow fashion. Because being fashion-forward does not always contribute to elegance. And elegance is what you want. Do you have to be an unstoppable force of charisma who looks impeccable all the time? Of course not! Your style could be more about comfort than fashion, but you have adopted that innate capability now to be charismatic. You are now the type of woman that everyone loves and is drawn towards. You become instantly and effortlessly attractive. \nSuddenly you're building your own unique self-brand. You start exuding influence in just about any setting without even intending to do so. People start trusting you more and whatever words you say to them will carry more credibility because you are the living epitome of elegance. Your words, actions, mannerisms and confidence become apparent. \nElegance as we know it is very rare indeed in the world we live in today. It was rare before, and even more rare now. \nUltimately the message we get across to others has very little to do with the words we use in any conversation. Our body language; the tone, pitch and volume we use in our voice, the expression on our face when we communicate, these are all part of the non-verbal communication that reveals our true nature. We can come across as insensitive and domineering, or shy and insecure. However, once we become more aware of all these innuendos and deliberately strive to achieve that elegance that is the hallmark of classiness, a shift happens. \nYour lifestyle and your surroundings start to match your persona. Your values shift to encompass all that you represent and embody. Now no matter what you say, do or express, all is in harmony. Now there is no doubt in anyone's mind who you are and what you are about. \nThis, my friends, is what you want. \n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "", "site": "huffington", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rani-st-pucchi/what-does-your-style-say-_b_12802718.html", "title": "What Does Your Style Say About You?"}, "185": {"text": "We asked a dermatologist why your beard is making you break out.\nYou\u2019ve decided to grow a beard this fall \u2014 good for you, buddy! But hold on a second, whether you\u2019re doing it for #movember, for better Tinder pics, or to keep your face warm this winter, you will definitely run into some snags as your new beard grows in. So don\u2019t be surprised if your face reacts badly to the change and you end up with some gnarly beard-related acne. This follicular side effect is gross, can be painful, and is unfortunately very common. But the good news is, there\u2019s a perfectly easy solution to your pimple problem. We asked Evan Rieder MD, FAAD, a general and cosmetic dermatologist and an Assistant Professor of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center, why guys break out when they grow a beard and how to avoid it in the future. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u201cWe often see an increase in acne and ingrown hairs (which may look like acne bumps) when men grow a beard or move from a clean shave to an unshaven look. The reasons for this are multifactorial, but most relate to hygiene. Men tend to negate beard grooming, and beard hair can collect a lot of debris and bacteria that can predispose to the development of acne.\u201d\nTranslation: \nDuring the day, your facial hair collects dust, dirt, and bacteria that can cause pimples. If you don\u2019t wash your beard that pimple causing bacteria thrives.\nEverything You Need To Take Care Of Your Beard\n\u201cTo help prevent and treat facial hair related pimples, men should wash their beard twice daily with a facial cleanser, switch pillowcases every few days, and pay better attention to grooming. Particularly in people with curly hair, short beard hair can grow back into the skin and cause a foreign-body response, which can lead to the development of red and painful bumps that look like acne. The body actually reacts to its own hair as something foreign, and mounts an immune response to it. We see less of these foreign-body responses once the beard is longer, however acne can still be a problem if the hygiene is poor. If these methods don\u2019t work, then a dermatologist can prescribe antibiotic treatments that may help keep acne at bay. If these problems persist despite medical therapy, laser therapy is a good way to remove problematic areas of hair that repeatedly cause bumps.\u201d\nPlan of Attack:\nMore from GQ:\nWhy Your Beard Is Red, Even If Your Hair Isn\u2019t\nThe Best Celebrity Haircuts of 2016\nThe Best Haircuts for Men\nThe Best Facial Hair for Your Face Shape\n7 Grooming Moves to Steal From Your Favorite Rapper\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"], "abstract": "By Liza Corsillo for GQ.   \n We asked a dermatologist why your beard is making you break out.  \n  \n You\u2019ve decided to grow a beard this fall \u2014 good...", "site": "huffington", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-get-rid-of-beard-related-pimples_us_5820e1e4e4b044f827a7917e", "title": "How To Get Rid Of Beard-Related Pimples"}, "186": {"text": "America is a country built by minorities and today we're running the risk of electing Donald Trump on a platform of segregation and xenophobia.

He argued the proposed regulations could help curb mass shootings by making it more difficult for people to purchase guns and ammunition.\n\u201cWe have the ability to do something about [mass shootings],\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the capacity to turn things around.\u201d\u00a0\nSome of the components of Proposition 63 were already put into place when California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed six gun bills into law this summer. However, Newsom argued\u00a0his proposed measure goes further than the laws signed by Brown and will close loopholes in existing state laws. For example, one law signed by Brown requires showing an ID and undergoing an instant background check in order to buy ammunition, while Newsom\u2019s proposal requires gun owners to obtain a four-year permit from California\u2019s Department of Justice before purchasing bullets.\u00a0\nThe initiative received support from many of the state\u2019s most prominent politicians, including Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and many other Democratic officials.\u00a0\nProposition 63 also faced fierce opposition from gun rights groups, which argued the rules would just make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns while doing nothing to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. A website called StopNewsom.com, funded by the Firearms Policy Coalition, particularly took issue with the measure\u2019s restrictions on ammunition purchases, calling the proposed rules \u201cburdensome\u201d and a \u201cmassive infringement on your Constitutional rights.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, the nation\u2019s most prominent gun lobby \u2015 the National Rifle Association \u2015 largely stayed out of the fray, spending just $95,000 to try to defeat the measure. (In contrast, the NRA has put up almost\u00a0$4 million to fight a background check measure in Nevada.) That disparity could be credited to California\u2019s demographics \u2015 the state is largely Democratic, and polls indicated the measure was likely to pass.\u00a0The laws signed by Brown earlier this year also may have discouraged the NRA from spending much on the campaign, as some of the components most objectionable to gun rights activists were already set to go into effect.\nDespite the group\u2019s relative absence from the campaign, Newsom has touted passing the ballot initiative as a victory over the NRA and other arms of the gun lobby. Earlier this month, Newsom challenged NRA executive Wayne LaPierre to a public debate on the measure:\u00a0\nProposition 63\u2019s components are set to go into effect next year.\n", "tags": ["politics"], "abstract": "The state has some of the strictest gun laws in the country.

This is known as \u201cneural entrainment.\u201d\u00a0If the stimulation is intense and sustained enough, then synchronized activity can spread throughout the brain.\nSuch synchronization can create a state of focused attention that silences normal self-awareness, allowing us to \u201close ourselves\u201d in the moment. We access a state of sensory absorption during a sexual trance, which can build up an intensity of experience that helps trigger climax.\u00a0\nFrom a neuroscientific perspective, sex may be an altered state of consciousness and perhaps even a form of meditative practice, according to Safron, who studies the neurological basis of sexual preference.\n\u201cThis way of viewing sexual experience is very different from, but consistent with, conceptualizing sex solely in terms of desire, pleasure, and arousal,\u201d he told The Huffington Post on Wednesday. \u201cI suspect that viewing sexuality as a kind of altered state of consciousness could help people to see sex as something extraordinary, potentially helping them to have a greater appreciation for their partners, and possibly even helping to prevent sex from losing its fascination.\u201d\nThis fits with what we know about orgasms. They usually result from rhythmic stimulation of body parts\u00a0that are high in sensory receptors. And\u00a0some studies of sexual climax have shown that brain regions involved in higher-order cognition and executive function deactivate, suggesting a temporary \u201closs of control.\u201d\u00a0\nIn this way,\u00a0sexual activity can be compared to music and dance \u2015 all involve the ability to lose oneself in a rhythm and to potentially access an altered state of consciousness. In several early cultures, anthropologists\u00a0have found evidence of rhythmic drumming,\u00a0singing, chanting and dancing being used to access trance states.\u00a0\nThe takeaway? Paying more attention to rhythm could be a powerful way to improve your sex life.\u00a0\n\u201cThe ability to maintain and adjust rhythms precisely, and with variety, helps to make someone both a good dancer and a good lover,\u201d Safron said.\u00a0\u201cFocusing on the rhythmic aspects of sexuality could both help people to enjoy sex more and to be more of the kinds of lovers that they want to be.\u201d\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "Rhythm holds the key to good sex, a study suggests.", "site": "huffington", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-pleasure-trance_us_581a0950e4b01f610e395c14", "title": "Sexual Pleasure Literally Puts You Into A Trance"}, "198": {"text": "Tired of the election?

It is also my contention that the several service calls which took the laptop apart could have very well caused harm to the motherboard. I asked Dell to consider these facts and repair the laptop at their expense. They have refused.\nI am pushing this issue because I think that it is only right for a company to stand behind their product. When a product is sold that is totally defective, then that product should have been replaced, and the warranty restarted. Dell seems to think that they do not have to stand behind their product.\nHaving worked for Fortune 500 companies, I'm well aware that there is an exception process for warranties that would seem to apply when a product has shown itself to be grossly problematic, as ours was. When this was brought to a supervisor's attention, he agreed that Dell had an exception process, but could not articulate why our computer would not apply.

But let\u2019s put the presidential campaign aside for a second and talk about weed.\u00a0\nMarijuana was on the ballot in nine states on Tuesday. Voters in eight of those states went to the polls and approved measures to roll back longstanding restrictions on the drug,\u00a0delivering a historic victory for marijuana police reformers.\nBy the end of the night, four states approved recreational marijuana, with California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine all rejecting prohibition and opting to tax and regulate the drug instead. The efforts doubled the number of states with legal weed, bringing the total to eight, which are home to nearly a quarter of the nation\u2019s population. Florida, Arkansas, North Dakota and Montana also voted on marijuana for medical use, bringing the total to 29 states and Washington, D.C. \nOnly Arizona, which was considering recreational marijuana legalization, voted down their measure on Tuesday.\nThe results, as well as the scale of the successes \u2015 which saw measures like Florida\u2019s passed by huge double-digit margins \u2015 will give a shot in the arm to the campaign for legalization and reform, said marijuana policy experts.\n\u201cThis is the most momentous Election Day in history for the movement to end marijuana prohibition,\u201d said Rob Kampia, executive director of Marijuana Policy Project. \u201cThese votes send a clear message to federal officials that it\u2019s time to stop arresting and incarcerating marijuana users. Congress must take action to ease the tension between state and federal marijuana laws.\u201d\nThe trend of state-level legalization reflects a broader cultural shift toward acceptance of marijuana, the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States. National support for the legalization of marijuana has risen dramatically in recent years, reaching historic highs in multiple polls just last month. States like Colorado have established regulated marijuana marketplaces, and successes there have debunked some lawmakers and law enforcers\u2019 predictions that such polices would result in disaster.\nStill, the federal government continues to ban cannabis, classifying it in Schedule I as one of the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d drugs, alongside heroin and LSD. States have been able to forge ahead on legalization despite the federal ban, helped in part by federal guidance that urged prosecutors to refrain from targeting marijuana operations that are legal under state law.\nPresident\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0has suggested the government may soon need to reassess its position. In an interview with \u201cReal Time\u201d host Bill Maher\u00a0on his show that aired last week, Obama said successes in the legalization movement should lead to \u201ca more serious conversation about how we are treating marijuana and our drug laws generally.\u201d\n\u201cIf, in fact, [marijuana legalization] passed in all these states [on Tuesday], you now have about a fifth of the country that\u2019s operating under one set of laws, and four-fifths in another,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe Justice Department, DEA, FBI \u2015 for them to try to straddle and figure out how they\u2019re supposed to enforce laws in some places and not in others \u2014 they\u2019re gonna guard against transporting these drugs across state lines, but you\u2019ve got the entire Pacific corridor where this is legal \u2014 that is not gonna be tenable.\u201d\nBut soon, federal marijuana policy will be in President-elect\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s court. Trump has said he would respect states\u2019 rights on the issue, but his potential incoming administration has some marijuana reformers worried.\nEthan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said he was deeply concerned because Trump\u2019s most likely appointees to senior law enforcement positions \u2015 former New York City Mayor\u00a0Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Gov.\u00a0Chris Christie\u00a0\u2015 and Vice President-elect Mike Pence \u201care no friends of marijuana reform.\u201d\n\u201cThe progress we\u2019ve made, and the values that underlie our struggle \u2015 freedom, compassion, reason and justice \u2015 will be very much at risk when Donald Trump enters the White House,\u201d he said.\nGiuliani has called legalizing marijuana in any form a \u201cmistake.\u201d\u00a0And Christie said if he were president, he would \u201ccrack down\u201d on legalization and \u201cenforce the federal laws.\u201d Both men have been rumored to be in line for cabinet positions in the Trump Administration, perhaps attorney general.\nTom Angell, chairman of drug policy reform group Marijuana Majority, said he expects Trump to hold true to his pledge not to interfere with existing state laws.\n\u201cTrump has clearly and repeatedly pledged to respect state marijuana laws, and we fully expect him to follow through on those promises, not only because it is the right thing to do but also because these reforms are broadly supported by a growing majority of voters,\u201d Angell said. \u201cReversing course and going against the tide of history would present huge political problems that the new administration does not need.\u201d\n", "tags": ["politics"], "abstract": "\u201cThis is the most momentous Election Day in history for the movement to end marijuana prohibition.\"", "site": "huffington", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/election-day-marijuana-votes_us_5822e05ae4b0aac6248854e6", "title": "Well, At Least Marijuana Won Big On Election Night"}, "203": {"text": "This 5-year-old\u2019s name is Rudy Toees, and he is very happy the Chicago Cubs won the World Series.\nThere is a lot of ugliness in the world right now, so I want to personally thank Rudy for reminding me that there is some goodness, too.

Which colleagues are the naysayers?\u00a0You know -- the\u00a0people\u00a0who you think of as \"The Mallet\" for their ability to smash promising ideas like a game of Whac-A-Mole.\nOf course, technology leaders should know how and when to say \"no\" to ideas that do not line up with the company's product plan. But if it feels like you are working in an arcade hall or your mental cheeks are a bit red from getting smacked around, something is terribly wrong.\nWhen \"no\" becomes the knee-jerk response to new ideas, it builds\u00a0a culture of fear that stifles innovation. And that is a real problem at companies large and small.\nLeading-edge companies recognize the danger in avoiding new things out of fear of the unfamiliar.\u00a0They embrace tireless iteration and changing course when better solutions arise. And they avoid that knee-jerk \"no.\"\nConsider\u00a0Toyota, which started as a loom-making company in the 1920s. Today they sell more cars globally than anyone else. Another good example is\u00a0General Electric. After significantly evolving over the last 124 years, GE is now\u00a0reinventing itself\u00a0as a digital powerhouse.\u00a0\nCompanies that act on new ideas lead the way to change -- outpacing the naysayers in the process. The ones left behind slowly sink under the weight of a thousand \"nos.\"\nIf you suspect your company is averse to new ideas, here are a few corrective\u00a0measures:\nShare the vision\nIs strategy shared with everyone -- or is it only for a privileged few? Forward-thinking leaders are transparent. It's not enough to\u00a0make goals visible\u00a0to the whole team. Each person needs to understand their unique value to the company and role in helping the company fulfill those goals. As a result, they're more likely to\u00a0ideate in ways that line up with the strategic vision. \u00a0\nSupport openness\nGood ideas can come from anywhere. Encourage a culture of openness and provide a forum for anyone to contribute new ideas or improve upon existing ones. At Aha! we built an\u00a0ideas portal\u00a0right into our roadmapping software so that anyone -- from customers to employees -- can submit enhancements and new solutions, as well as vote on the ones they'd most like to see implemented.\u00a0\nStay invested\nManagers with a \"no\" mindset are quick to poke holes without acknowledging merit. But hastily rejecting a fledgling idea helps no one -- least of all the\u00a0person trying to contribute\u00a0to the success of the organization. When you show that you are invested, your team will not deflate when an idea is not adopted. Before rejecting an idea,\u00a0ask thoughtful questions to make sure you fully understand what is being suggested and push the creator to fully vet the possibilities.\u00a0\nShow kindness\nYou can be a decisive leader and say \"no\" to a weak idea without crushing someone's spirit. Be honest and specific to help the person understand why their idea may be premature -- which may help lead to a better one. If there were elements of the idea that you did like, say so! If not, explain the value framework that you are using to dismiss it. Encourage them to keep on contributing.\u00a0\nNot every idea will make the cut. But innovative companies promote a culture where ideas stand a chance to thrive.\u00a0\nSmart leaders do not allow fear to rule the day. They are not afraid to imagine the possibilities and ask \"what if.\" They are open-minded about the future\u00a0and support an ongoing stream of ideas that will help the company compete and innovate.\nThese are the companies and the people\u00a0that I love to work with, and you likely do too. We should all put the mallet down before we smack what actually matters.\u00a0\nHow does your company avoid the culture of \"no\"?\n", "tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "Take a moment and think about your team.

The real estate industry is adopting this evolving technology to help you buy and sell your home in ways never before possible.\nSay you're moving to another state, or you're interested in buying new construction and your home hasn't been built. You can take a virtual tour of your future home without leaving the comfort of the one you live in now.\nOr maybe it's time to sell, and you want a leg up in a competitive market. Now you can entice potential buyers with a 3-D rendering of your home before they step inside for a showing.\nHow does it work?\n\"Real estate is probably the only asset class that is experiential and trades in emotion,\" says Steven Giles, a broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate in New York. \"I think virtual reality technology has greatly enhanced that experience.\" Giles says that in competitive markets, it's especially helpful for sellers to have access to the latest technology.\nSan Francisco-based Matterport is one of several media technology companies offering brokers, real estate agents and service providers 3-D cameras to capture a home's interior. Matterport stitches the images together to provide a walkthrough that uploads onto a cloud service. You can view the property as a 3-D model using your smartphone, tablet, computer or virtual reality headset.\nMatterport is now adding elements of augmented reality -- the superimposing of computer elements onto real settings -- to its walkthroughs, says CEO Bill Brown. \"In addition to being able to walk through the space, people can mark in objects within the space, and they can annotate those objects,\" he says. These notes can highlight features such as granite countertops or energy-efficient appliances.\nVirtual reality tours are a good way to reduce the number of physical home walkthroughs you have to make because they help you narrow down your search, Brown says. He's seen buyers arrive at the first open house ready to make an offer because they've already done a virtual walkthrough. \"It just builds momentum around the transaction much more quickly.\"\nReal estate media company Circle Visions, also based in San Francisco, is working on another use of the technology: creating properties that don't yet exist. People who are building their own home or remodeling their current one can use virtual reality headsets to get a sense of what the property will look like once it's completed.\n\"When you look at a blueprint, you don't really get a sense of how it feels to be in that property, whereas with virtual reality, you're right in it,\" says Bob Yuan, president of Circle Visions. \"You can open doors, you can turn on the lights; you get a feel for the scale or the sense of that room.\"\nHow much does it cost?\nAs a seller, you won't pay a real estate company specifically for your property to be viewed through virtual reality, but the service cost might be included in your agent's fees. If your real estate agent can create a 3-D model of your home, ask her how much she charges for this service. Homebuyers don't have to pay anything to view homes in virtual reality.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks?\nMoving from room to room in a virtual space might make some homebuyers feel a bit wobbly. Because VR is in its early stages, people are still figuring out the right techniques, Brown says. \"I liken it to website design way back when the internet was new,\" he says. \"You would see all kinds of weird things in terms of how people set up their websites. Eventually people kind of settled on a set of norms for navigation and layout.\"\nYou may also have some trouble finding a real estate agent or broker who uses the technology, especially if you don't live in a large metropolitan area. Most brokerage and real estate firms still use 2-D photography and video walkthroughs to market properties. And the companies that do use virtual reality are, for the most part, marketing higher-end properties.\nIf your broker or real estate agent doesn't use virtual reality, ask her whether she'd be willing to look into it, as it could benefit her business as well.\nWhere is the technology headed?\nBrown predicts that virtual reality will someday replace 2-D photography. \"To me, there's no reason to have a gallery of disjointed pictures without having that spatial tie, when just as easily you can create an immersive environment of that space,\" he says.\nGiles thinks virtual reality will become more common in the coming years and that it could replace traditional sales offices or model homes or apartments.\n", "tags": ["business"], "abstract": "By Michael Burge\n\nVirtual reality is no longer associated with just gaming.

Many changes have taken place in the past few years, and not all of them were for the best.\nFacing stiff competition from European and Japanese manufacturers and the continual rise of Polaris and its motorcycle division, Harley is finding difficulty in reaching its revised target of 264,000-269,000 motorcycle shipments this year.\nAmerica's largest motorcycle manufacturer is losing shares to foreign competitors such as Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Honda. Not only are their shares dropping, but the company has also faced legal issues.\nAround October 2016, Harley Davidson had to pay a $12 million penalty to the federal government due to an accusation of selling around 340,000 motorcycles that polluted the air at a rate higher than the federal Clean Air Act allows. Many Americans prefer to buy a car as opposed to a motorcycle. \nWhat does it signal?\nThe trends are shifting, and people are more conscious regarding health, comfort and their overall status.\nIn Q3 2016, the net profit for Harley Davidson reduced by 19%, or $114.1 million, compared to $140.3 million at a similar time last year, according to the company. \nThe consolidated revenue amounted to $1.27 billion compared to last year's $1.32 billion during the same period. \nIn 2014, US market share rose to 55.5%, and by 2015, there was a significant drop to 51.9%. Since then, the shares have increased by only 1%. \n\"The deliveries of Harley Davison bikes to Europe have significantly declined over the last few years. The Milwaukee motorcycle producer is planning to reorganize its production in Q4. The plan is to reduce the number of staff, which will cost the company an estimated $20-25 million,\" says, David Collins, A1AutoTransport Inc. \nDucati has a high potential of overtaking Harley Davidson if the statistics continue as they're going.\nDucati's sales increased by 10% in 2015 in the United States, while Harley Davidson's sales decreased by 1.7%. Besides Ducati's growth, other companies are also giving tough competition to this heavyweight motorcycle.\nHonda has always been famous for its cars, and few people knew of the fact that the company manufacturers motorcycles as well.\nHowever, in 2015, motorcycles brought so much profit for Honda that it became its third largest business segment. You might wonder if the first one is cars and the third one is motorcycles, then what's the second one? \nThe answer is: \nFinancial services. This sector brings Honda just as much profit as motorcycles do. \nLooking at the total motorcycle market figures from January to March 2016, there were 24,994 sales made. Honda was a leading manufacturer by volume with 5,512 units sold.\nYamaha was in the second spot with 4,995 units. In the last places, with an average of 2400 units sold, were Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Harley Davidson, as stated in the order.\nHowever, this picture changes if you look at road motorcycles only. Even though Honda is still the leading manufacturer, Harley-Davidson took second place in the sales department in 2016.\nJust like cars, motorbikes have individual classes from sports to luxury and comfort. So, it is unfair to compare different categories of motorcycles only by the number of sales made.\nHarley Davidson is a brand known for its unique style and elegance. \nNowadays, younger generations are looking for speed, sporty style, and comfort in the vehicles they drive. They lead active lives and drive fast cars, so it only makes sense that they'd want fast motorcycles too.\nThis is where Harley-Davidson, unfortunately, can't compete. The top leaders of the fastest bikes are Suzuki with a top speed of 248mph, Kawasaki with 220mph and Ducati with 169mph.\nRay of Hope\nMatt Levatich, the CEO of motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, wants U.S. suppliers to be globally competitive by matching the costs of overseas rivals. \nHe also considers young adults as the most important segment. The investments on new engines, favoring a particular model, and other updates won't be decided by the core market of just older white men. \nThe bikes that appeal to younger adults, women, and minorities will be given more priority. Just like with anything in life, the new replaces the old, and if you don't catch up with what's in demand, your brand will get replaced as well.\nHarley Davidson still has many more years of success in the market, but if they continue in the way they are going now, the end will eventually come.\n", "tags": ["business"], "abstract": "", "site": "huffington", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yatin-khulbe/the-startling-decline-of-_b_12796210.html", "title": "The Startling Decline of Harley Davidson"}, "212": {"text": "Operational simplicity has prevailed over customization. McDonald's said it has ended its \"Create Your Taste\" customization platform in the U.S. in favor of the simpler \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" platform that it began testing in San Diego in February. The story was first reported by Business Insider.\nThe \"Create Your Taste\" (CYT) platform uses kiosks where customers choose from a wide variety of options--from proteins to buns and toppings--to build a burger as they want it. With \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" customers choose one of four \"Flavors\" (topping combinations)  plus one of three bun options and a protein (beef, grilled chicken or Crispy buttermilk Chicken). The \"Signature\" platform was initially tested in 2015 under the name \"TasteCrafted.\"\n\n\"Signature Crafted Recipes'\" four \"Flavors\" offered in test are 'Pico Guacamole\" (pico de gallo, guacamole, buttermilk ranch, white Cheddar and leaf lettuce), \"Maple Bacon Dijon\" (maple-flavored bacon, Dijon mustard, caramelized onion, white Cheddar and lettuce), Deluxe (lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo) and \"Buffalo Bacon\" (blue cheese spread, buffalo sauce, applewood-smoked bacon, tomato and lettuce).\n\nIn San Diego and selected Pacific Northwest test markets, the \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" platform also has offered a \"Signature Sriracha\" combination (above) with sriracha-flavored Big Mac sauce, baby spinach, white Cheddar, baby Kale, crispy onions and choice of protein. BurgerBusiness.com reported the test in June. \nCYT originated in 2014 and was first widely implemented and refined in Australia. It arrived in China in 2015; Canada started rolling it out in September 2015 and it has been added across Europe we couldn't make it work, apparently.\nCYT was developed during the administration of former CEO Don Thompson. In a Jan. 23, 2015, Q4 earnings call with analysts very shortly before he was replaced by current CEO Steve Easterbrook, Thompson said McDonald's had \"plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year.\" It didn't happen. \nThompson also said it \"has the potential to lift sales of core classics, by bringing more customers into our restaurants.\" Apparently that hasn't happened either.\nEasterbrook hosted a \"Turnaround Summit\" for franchisees in April 2015, presenting ideas that could help reverse the brand's sales slide in the U.S. CYT was among those concepts, but not all franchisees were impressed with its complexity or the cost to implement it. In a survey conducted by restaurant Mark Kalinowski, several voiced concerns. \"The ideas presented--such as Create Your Taste--do not fit our business model,\" said one.\nSaid anther operator, \"CYT will cost approximately $125,000 per restaurant. It sounds like, initially, sales with this new concept are very slow taking off.\" \nEasterbrook has touted CYT's success in Australia and elsewhere as examples of how the  \"Experience of the Future\" for McDonald's will evolve: more customization, more technology such as kiosk ordering and expanded table service. All that remains possible with \"Signature Crafted Recipes.\"\n\"Create Your Taste was a test, which we used as the name for customizable burgers in select U.S. cities.  McDonald's is now testing a customizable burger platform under the name 'Signature Crafted Recipes.'\n\"We continue to test a more modern restaurant experience in select markets in the U.S. featuring kiosks that allow customers to pick their bun, protein and ingredients under the Signature Crafted concept and also enjoy table service.  \n\n\"We are excited for our customers to experience the interactive and engaging features at these restaurants as well as the Signature Crafted concept, and we look forward to leveraging their feedback in our journey to bring a new level of convenience and excitement to the McDonald's restaurant experience.\"\n", "tags": ["business"], "abstract": "Operational simplicity has prevailed over customization.

It\u2019s really not that radical, and it\u2019s sad that it still needs saying.\u201d\nWhile Peck acknowledged that major retailers like John Lewis have made great progress on this issue in recent years, he said it\u2019s still important for people to call out products that promote harmful gender stereotypes\u00a0when they see them.\u00a0\u00a0\nJohn Lewis representatives have taken note of Peck\u2019s tweet and maintain that it was simply a matter of erroneous labeling.\u00a0A spokesperson for the company told HuffPost UK:\nWhether or not the label was an error, Peck is still pleased that the tweet provoked an important discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to use words without thinking about what message they send to our kids, so its great to break that down, even if just by the tiniest bit,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI also hope retailers will realize there are lots of people out there who really care about this stuff and keep working to improve.\u201d\n#LetToysBeToys\n", "tags": ["science"], "abstract": "\"What is it about this lunch box which makes it unsuitable for my daughter?\"", "site": "huffington", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dad-calls-out-needlessly-gendered-label-on-space-themed-lunch-box_us_581b569ae4b0c43e6c1e7ce9", "title": "Dad Calls Out Needlessly Gendered Label On Space-Themed Lunch Box"}, "214": {"text": "By Al Norman\nIt took a jury one minute to find 57-year-old Vicki Carll not guilty of shoplifting from Wal-Mart. The real crime was what Wal-Mart put her through by seeking prosecution when they knew she was innocent.\nAccording to court documents filed in Florida, Vicki Carll, a disabled mother, has retaliated for how Wal-Mart treated her by filing a lawsuit of her own against the retailer over the alleged shoplifting incident at a  Wal-Mart in Tampa two  years ago.  \nOn January 2, 2014, Carll went to Wal-Mart to buy dog food. After browsing the aisles, Carll went to the pet food aisle, put a large bag of dog food in her cart, and picked up a box of  flea medication to read the instructions. She noticed that this particular  box of flea medication had already been opened.  It appeared that the contents of the box were still inside and were undisturbed.\nCarll began walking on for a while with the flea medication in her hand, reading the instructions. She realized that this medication was for dogs much larger than hers, so she returned the box to a nearby shelf. Carll proceeded to the check-out stand to pay for her dog food. She was unaware that a Wal-Mart \"floor- walker\" had been following her from a distance. According to the lawsuit, the \"floor walker's job... is to look out for retail theft.\"  \nCarll's complaint says the Wal-Mart worker \"had an ulterior plan and motive for which Ms. Carll seemed to be the perfect victim.\" The complaint alleges that the Wal-Mart loss prevention worker had observed Carll \"pick up the box of flea and tick medication and watched from hiding as she returned it to the shelf.\"\nThe floor-walker \"secretly followed behind her and surreptitiously grabbed the box of flea and tick medication from the shelf where Ms. Carll had returned it.\" He then went to the main entrance/exit area of the store and positioned himself on a bench just inside the main doors and waited for Ms. Carll to approach, keeping the box of pet medication concealed from view.\nWhile Carll was standing in the check-out line, the floor-walker \"removed the individual doses from the medication box and laid them on the ground under the bench where he sat in wait for Ms. Carll.\" \"As would soon become clear,\" the worker's \"seemingly inexplicable behavior was actually part of an elaborate plan concocted...to frame an innocent shopper and allow him to make an arrest, or 'stop,' on his very first day on the job, thereby ingratiating himself  with his Wal-Mart employer.\" \n\nAs she passed by the bench, the floor-walker, \"leapt off his bench as soon as she passed and fell in directly behind her.\" He then \"physically accosted\" Carll on the sidewalk, and \"with his full force and strength, physically took hold of Ms. Carll and began dragging her by force back inside the store to a spot next to the bench.\"\nThe floor-walker was then joined by a second Wal-Mart employee who also \"physically lay hands\" on Vicki Carll, and dragged her back inside the store to the bench, and \"forcefully threw Ms. Carll to the ground.\" \"The force of being thrown to the ground caused Ms. Carll intense pain, as she had a pre-existing back injury from an automobile accident. The take-down...severely aggravated Ms. Carll's condition and caused her additional injuries.\"  \nThe floor-walker then \"reached under the bench and pretended to find the doses of pet medication scattered there beneath the bench. \"Feigning surprise,\" the floor-walker \"loudly - and falsely - proclaimed that Ms. Carll had attempted to steal the medicine by hiding it in her sleeve, and that she must have dropped it when she was forced to the ground.\" The Wal-Mart worker  \"falsely claimed that he had witnessed Ms. Carll take and conceal the pet medication while inside the store. He said that he had then 'sprung a trap' for her and had caught her in the act of trying to steal the pet medicine doses.\"\n \"Apparently unbeknownst\" to the floor-walker, however, \"Wal-Mart maintained security surveillance cameras in the area of the store entrance which recorded the events of that day.\"  The video footage shows the floor-walker himself removing the pet medication doses from its box as he sat on the bench waiting for Carll to check out. According to the lawsuit, the video shows the floor-walker placing the medication doses on the ground underneath the bench. \nWithin an hour after the \"forced takedown and false arrest scheme,\" Wal-Mart had available to it the video surveillance footage that \"conclusively demonstrated Ms. Carll's innocence and the attempted frame-up by its employee.\" The complaint charges that Wal-Mart knew \"without question\" that Carll was innocent, that their own employee \"had falsely accused her and planted false evidence to support the false accusations.\" \nYet Wal-Mart \"took the almost incomprehensible step of initiating criminal charges and  proceedings against Ms. Carll.\" The lawsuit says that Wal-Mart \"intentionally and recklessly forced Ms. Carll to undergo the fear and humiliation of having to face criminal charges and forced her to live for a substantial time with the fear of being wrongfully convicted of a charge on which she was innocent.\" Carll \"had to endure the humiliation of being processed into the criminal justice system all the way through a jury trial,\" \nBut soon the humiliation flipped. According to Channel 10 News/Tampa, a Hillsborough County jury \"found Carll not guilty in less than a minute.\" Carll's attorney told Channel 10, \"I've never seen a case I can think about where the bad guy -- in this case the Wal-Mart employee -- was actually caught on video planting the evidence.\"\nThe complaint notes that Wal-Mart \"allowed its employees to take the witness stand under oath and falsely accuse Ms. Carll of an act of theft which Wal-Mart knew she had not committed.\" The litigation says Wal-Mart \"apparently decided to carry the charade of criminal proceedings to their ultimate conclusion by jury trial just to try to protect itself from civil liability by not admitting the outrageous wrongdoing of its own employees.\"\nCarll's attorney says \"she has been placed on anti-anxiety medications which she never before had to take and suffers from a fear of being in public and in social situations...Ms. Carll no longer shops at public retail stores unless absolutely necessary and makes her purchases on line whenever possible.\" \nOn Halloween, Carll's attorney filed a petition in the Thirteenth Circuit for Hillsborough County, Florida, seeking a jury trial and damages against defendants Wal-Mart and its two employees. One of the jurors that sat on the panel during Wal-Mart's original prosecution  against Carll told Channel 10 News he \"couldn't believe the state wasted time and money with this case.\"\nAfter the jury acquitted Carll, Wal-Mart issued a statement which began: \"This was an unfortunate event in a number of ways.\" But the retailer expressed no remorse and accepted no blame for what happened to Vicki Carll.\nThis elaborate entrapment and prosecution was over a bottle of flea medication worth $29, proving once again that Wal-Mart knows the price of everything -- but  the value of nothing.\nAl Norman is the founder of Sprawl-Busters.
