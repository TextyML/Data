Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards has taken responsibility for their weekend loss to Australia

The Wallabies ran riot in Cardiff to score five tries and send Wales to their heaviest home beating in a decade.

Edwards’ defence has leaked 32 tries in the last six matches, but he is determined to find the answers and restore some pride ahead of next weekend’s clash with Argentina.

“Their attack coach Stephen Larkham got the better of me. I’ll hold my hands up,” he said. “But I’m a determined person.

“They had 80 per cent of the possession in the first half and 75 per cent of the territory, we conceded three tries and it could have been more.

“The tackling wasn’t too bad but first and foremost we lost the advantage line. Their front five were consistently gaining ground and creating quick ball.

“It’s incredibly difficult to hold out a team in periods like that, especially the way the game has gone in the past 12 months with more and more tries being scored.
