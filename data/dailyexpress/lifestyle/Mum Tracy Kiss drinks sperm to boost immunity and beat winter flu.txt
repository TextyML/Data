TRACYKISS.COM Mum Tracy Kiss drinks sperm in her morning drink

The 29-year-old Buckinghamshire local adds a spoonful of sperm to her morning drink. She has been doing this every day for the last month and insists it’s given her a healthy dose of get-up-and-go. The nutritional adviser said: “I’d been feeling run down and had no energy, but now I’m full of beans and my mood has improved.” So how does she source her semen? Tracy has convinced her 31-year-old single friend to help her out.

He now drops over three tubs a week but it took a little while to bring him round to the unique idea. Tracy said: “When I first approached him, he was concerned I’d use it to impregnate myself. “But once I’d convinced him it was for my beauty regime he agreed – after all, he has a regular supply at hand!” “It can taste really good – depending on what my friend has been eating. My other mates think I’m strange, but I don’t give a toss.”

Tracy is a vegan and chooses to mix the semen with almond or coconut milk, fruit and seeds. But she also drinks her friend’s sperm on its own, commenting: “Every batch tastes different, depending on what he’s been eating. “If he’s been drinking alcohol or eaten something particularly pungent like asparagus, I ask him to give me a heads up so I know not to drink it neat. “Things like pineapple and peppermint make it taste better, but I’ll happily take it straight off a spoon usually.”
