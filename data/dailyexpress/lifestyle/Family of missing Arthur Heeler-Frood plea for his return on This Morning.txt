ITV The Heeler-Frood family appeared on This Morning to plea for their missing son Arthur to return

Appearing on This Morning to appeal for their son’s whereabouts, Caroline Heeler-Frood and husband Jeremy put out a desperate plea for Arthur to return in time for Christmas. Arthur, from Axminster, Devon, was reported missing on September 6, nine weeks ago. That day, just as he usually did, Arthur set off on his bike to college but he failed to return home later that day. As Arthur was at college there was no obligation for them to contact his parents of his absence.

Caroline said: “I drove up to the Post Office where he would usually park his bike but there was no sign of it. “I started to get very anxious, as this had never happened before.” A day after Arthur’s disappearance his parents received a letter from him which sated he had run away, that he was bored of his life, and for them not to find him. He asked them to understand why he had to do this and said he’d return in under a year. Arthur’s parents described him as the type of boy who was quite adventurous, and they encourage all their children to be independent.

Arthur’s older brother is currently away travelling as part of his gap year, and his sister began her first year of university this year. Caroline said: “He might have been anxious because his sister just started uni this year, his older brother has been away for a year already, and he was not looking forward to being at home on his own. “He spent quite a biota time in his bedroom over the summer. “He was an avid reader, but he was not forthcoming and didn’t want to share anything with us.”
