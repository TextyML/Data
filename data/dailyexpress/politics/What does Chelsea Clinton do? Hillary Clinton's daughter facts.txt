The Clintons’ daughter could make history by becoming the First Daughter for the second time if her mother wins the US election.

Chelsea, 36, went through her awkward teenage years while living in the White House with her mother and her father, then US President Bill Clinton.

But her experience as First Daughter will be very different if Mrs Clinton is elected as the first female President of America.

At the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Chelsea spoke about how her parents had made her realise the importance of public service.

She told the convention: “I am here as a proud American, a proud Democrat, a proud mother and in particular a very, very proud daughter.”
