The comments from Geoffrey Van Orden come as the European Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee is set to vote on a report calling for action following the threat of terrorism, conflict in the Middle East and increased aggression from Russia.

Eurosceptics fear that federalists in the EU will seek to force through a more integrated defence strategy, including an EU army.

Mr Van Orden slammed the “ayatollahs of European integration” for what he saw as using Brexit to bring about a European Defence Union.

He told EuroparlTV: “I suppose many would say that the United Kingdom has been the most hesitant about a European Defence Union. We don't want to see a European army.

“Maybe with the prospect of the UK now leaving the European Union, they see this as an opportunity. And indeed I've heard that some of the ayatollahs of European integration that exist in this Parliament have specifically said this.”
