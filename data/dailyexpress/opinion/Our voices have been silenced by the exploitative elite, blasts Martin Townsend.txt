GETTY Gina Miller is the wife of a multi-millionaire financier

I don’t want to be looked down on because I live in the “wrong” place or went to a non-Oxbridge university (although actually I went to none at all) or didn’t pack my terrified children off to some grim but over-priced boarding school in the middle of nowhere. At heart I have a mortal dread of the so-called “elite”, those who presume privilege because of their wealth and social status, and I believe I am at one with most people in that sense of foreboding. All of which brings me to Brexit and the decision by the High Court not to allow the Prime Minister to invoke Article 50 (which will start the formal process of leaving the EU) without going to Parliament.

In an instant the 17.4 million of us who voted for Brexit have effectively been overruled. The instruction to Government that we delivered, accepted by the Act of Parliament that initiated the referendum and by Theresa May and her ruling party, is to be ignored in favour of a vote in Parliament that will almost certainly go against it. Brexit will assuredly be achieved, in the end, hopefully after a general election that will destroy Corbyn’s spiteful and useless Labour Party and spell the beginning of the end for the unelected House Of Lords.

GETTY Theresa May will not be able to trigger Article 50 without a vote in Parliament

But this largely unwanted and totally unwarranted delay may also create months of economic turmoil... and, yes, this is exactly the outcome that many Remainers hoped would result from the Brexit vote itself. Their palpable disappointment that Osborne’s fiscal Armageddon didn’t occur, and the acrid stench of sour grapes they have wafted over the minimal disruption that followed, has been one of the saddest and most anti-British displays of petulance it has ever been my misfortune to witness.

This selfish and exploitative elite have been at the root of Britain’s problems for too long

What is even more disturbing is that the prime movers behind this legal ruling are the most insidious of all the elites in this country. They are a rabble of stinking rich bankers, financiers, hedge fund buccaneers and sneering, gimlet-eyed investors who give not a single hoot for anyone who doesn’t live in one of London’s smarter postcodes, shop in Sloane Street and send their children to Eton and Harrow.

Many of them are Mrs May’s “citizens of the world... citizens of nowhere”, the conveniently anonymous global rich who flooded London in the Noughties, buying up homes in Chelsea and Kensington and leaving them largely uninhabited. The same people who despoil the very foundations of our capital city by hollowing out vast “iceberg” basements under their mansions.

GETTY The former model allegedly appeared as a silhouette at the beginning of a Bond film

For these people the bloated EU, with its endless layers of overpaid executives, pettifogging bureaucrats and impenetrable rules and regulations, its army of lawyers and pen-pushing time-wasters is exactly what is required: a bullying behemoth that baffles and blind-sides ordinary folk like us and allows these people to line their pockets. The poster girl for this greedy elite is Gina Miller, the Guyanaborn wife of a multimillionaire financier who has led the campaign by “Wrexiteers” to frustrate the will of the public. Former model Miller, an investment expert and philanthropist, inspired the character of Blackeyes in one of maverick playwright Dennis Potter’s infamously louche plays (well, he’s dead and can’t argue otherwise) and was also allegedly a slinky female silhouette at the beginning of a Bond film. How appropriate.

For many of those who have been backing Miller’s efforts, and those of one Deir Dos Santos, a Brazilian hairdresser who was, bafflingly, the first to lodge a complaint about Article 50 with the courts, are also silhouettes. They are shadows, cyphers, under-the-radar movers and shakers. They are as far removed from you and I, the Mr and Mrs Ordinary Folk who voted for Brexit for all the right reasons, as it is possible to get. Few of them will ever have ventured north of Oxford Street let alone into the heartlands where Brexit was won. What interest would they have in clawing back the nation’s sovereignty, taking back control of our borders and revitalising our economy?
