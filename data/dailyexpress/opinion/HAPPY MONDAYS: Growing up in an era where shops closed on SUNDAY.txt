GETTY “We are all used to 24-hour shops and restaurants”

When you have grown up in an era when all shops were closed on a Sunday, did half days on Wednesday and pubs would shut at 2.30pm each day you will know true suffering. Even though we are well used to 24 -hour shops and restaurants and the internet providing opportunities to gamble, bank and find a life partner 24/7 I’m sure that I’m not the only one left feeling this way. These thoughts are not limited to commerce and entertainment but to one’s likes, dislikes and emotions too.

It always feels like I’ve tortured a teddy bear if I confess to a genuine dislike of chocolate (so awkward when presented as a gift), prefer prosecco over champagne (it’s a migraine thing), have a dread of weddings (12 hours around a table with people you run out of conversation with in 20 minutes) and have never watched Strictly or Bake Off (just haven’t). It’s like I’ve killed Bambi to say I will pass on the cake, strawberries aren’t my thing and I don’t like trainers as footwear beyond the gym or track. For some reason I have an aversion to bobble hats, grey shoes on men and the word “gobsmacked” too but I own all of these quirks without shame or issue.

Am I allowed though to feel the things I feel? Are you? Is it OK to not like that guy everyone else thinks is a real card? To hate the school-gate cliques? Social media?

Am I allowed to feel lonely for no reason, to have flickers of sadness when all is well and to feel like the only one who is not seeing the funny side nor that elusive silver lining? Sometimes our thoughts almost feel like they are not our own. They can be mean, unworthy or so downright nasty you’d move seats on the bus to get away from them.

There is something admirable about owning up. Like singer Adele who confessed to post-natal depression and finding motherhood less than a fairy story. Maybe for some it is and we are so often sold the line that being a mum is deeply rewarding and from this path of conventional approval is somehow deviant or abhorrent.

Thus those who feel sad, depressed or overwhelmed feel odd and marginalised simply for being in their own truth. Feeling that our thoughts are somehow wrong or unacceptable only compounds our feelings of alienation. How grateful we are though when some honest person offers a “is it just me or this really dismal?” type of comment when you’re all dying a small death under the umbrella of social niceness.

Sufi poet Rumi beautifully allows us to give house room to all our thoughts whether whimpering or wailing in his piece The Guest House where he urges us to honour all our feelings politely as though they were visitors. “The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.” You’re allowed to be human in all its complex nuances. You are a fully paid-up member of humanity. Not only are you allowed but most welcome.

He put Kirsty Young straight on his rocky road to fame which was one of rejection, humiliation and tenacity and not some Hollywood sugar -sweet journey to easy street. He had his dark years and his belief in the power of song pulled him through. His choice of songs by Sinatra, Eminem and Leonard Cohen really showed him to be an authentic voice of now with a respectful nod to the talents who have gone before.

________________________________________ Someone once asked the composer Brian Eno what he was up to after being in Roxy Music. “Same notes, different order,” was his smart as a whip reply. The right words in the right order can change lives and worlds. The old cliché, “I will believe it when I see it” has a whole new resonance when you think of it instead as: “I will see it when I believe it.”
