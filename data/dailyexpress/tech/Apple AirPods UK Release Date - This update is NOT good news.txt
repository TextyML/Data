EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS Apple's wireless AirPod headphones might not hit UK shelves until January 2017

Following the revelation that Apple had delayed its highly-anticipated AirPods beyond their original October launch date, the US firm has remained silent on when customers can expect the futuristic headphones. But a new report from the company's supply chain in China points to a UK release date in early 2017. The news comes from the Economic Daily News which talked to a number of marker watchers who believe AirPods manufacturing supplier Inventec will see a profit boost in January, following the launch of the device. Inventec is now expected to start shipping AirPods by January 2017, the paper claims. The connection between Inventec, known predominantly as a PC supplier business, and Apple's AirPods first came from reliable technology analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, of KGI Securities back in September.

Last month, a spokesperson for Apple told TechCrunch: "The early response to AirPods has been incredible. "We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." Apple announced the AirPod headphones during the iPhone 7 launch event, back in September. With the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple decided to ditch the industry-standard 3.5mm audio port. AirPods are a flagship product designed to showcase what is possible in the new wireless audio world.

The new Bluetooth headphones boast high-quality audio playback and are designed to harness the power of the cloud to automatically pair with all of your Apple devices. Simply place the AirPods close to your iPhone and with one tap, they are immediately set-up with all the devices signed into your iCloud account, including your iPad and Mac. AirPods will intelligently switch between iPhone, Apple Watch and your MacBook as you move between gadgets. Beam-forming directional microphones in the stem also let you use voice assistant Siri while wearing the headphones, who can be summoned with a double-tap. Siri lets you select and control your music, change the volume, check your battery life, as well as the other standard queries the virtual assistant is used to fielding from iPhone owners. An accelerometer built into each AirPod detects when you’re speaking, enabling the microphones to focus on the sound of your voice, filtering out external noise.

Because these new headphones do not include any wires – they need a battery and, with the ultra-efficient Apple W1 chip powering them, they pack some five hours of battery life for audio playback. Apple AirPod headphones ship with a companion charging case, that lets you top-up the wireless headphones with an additional 24 hours of battery life. If you fancy a pair they will set you back £159, which includes the AirPods and charging case.
