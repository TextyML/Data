The hub will service stores in and around Hampshire, Dorset and West Sussex, as Lidl expands operations in the south of England. At the same time, there are two more warehouses under construction, while four existing centres are being expanded. Marco Ivone, regional director at Lidl UK, said: “The opening of our new Southampton RDC marks an incredibly exciting time for the business, particularly in the South. "Not only is it necessary to accommodate the scale of our existing and future operations in the area, we have been able to create significant job opportunities as a result of the new warehouse and will continue to invest in the South as we move forward with our expansion plans.”
