GETTY Britain's manufacturing exports have been boosted by the weak pound

Orders from America, China and the European Union (EU) shot up in October amid a weaker pound, according to the Markit Manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI)



Output in the sector was measured at 54.3 in October, down from the 27-month high of 55.5 in September, but well above the long-running average of 51.5 - any reading above 50 indicates growth.



New order volumes increased for the third consecutive month and at rate almost as fast as Septemberâ€™s recent high, showed the index.



A fall in sterling helped boost demand for British goods abroad, but domestic demand was also strong, showed the index.

All sectors reported output growth, but the strongest sub-sector was intermediate goods sector, which saw production rise at the quickest pace in a year.



At the same time the employment index rose to its highest level in a year.



However, the weaker pound also increased import costs for managers, which input costs rising at the fastest rate since January 2011.



Sterling is down around 20 per cent against the US dollar and 15 per cent against the euro following the vote to leave the EU.
