Since 1970, a staggering 58 per cent of vertebrae populations have died, and by 2020, experts believe that two thirds of fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals will have disappeared.

As the human population continues to grow and moves into other animals natural habitats, other species are left with nowhere to go and become extinct.

A report from the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) says deforestation, increased demand for food, as well as a rise in pollution, are pushing extinction rates to 100 times their natural level.

Freshwater animals have seen an 81 per cent decline in their numbers, while a plethora of animals, including killer whales, African elephants, leatherback turtles, gorillas and rhinoceroses are on the brink of extinction.
