Despite huge advances in scientists’ understanding of the Universe in recent decades, where the Cosmos came from remains a mystery.

Equally mysterious to experts are black holes – but now some experts are starting to consider whether the two are connected in some way.

At the beginning of time, 13.8 billion years ago, there was a dense and super-hot energetic point where the laws of physics did not apply – what is known as a singularity.

The only other thing in the Universe where a singularity occurs and the laws of physics are thrown out of the window is at the event horizon of a black hole, which is unexplainable by current scientific methods.
