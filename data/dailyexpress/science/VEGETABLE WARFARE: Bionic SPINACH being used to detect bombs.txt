GETTY Scientists are using spinach to detect landmines

Experts placed the microscopic tubes in the leaves of spinach in the hope of making bomb detection easier and safer. Once the tubes are inserted, the plant has the ability to detect nitro-aromatics – elements found in land mines and other explosives. A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) put nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes into the leaves. They then put nitro-aromatics into water, and waited for the spinach to soak it up through the soil.

MIT The plant gives off almost infrared fluorescent light which can be detected

Once the water has been drawn through the roots of the spinach and is in the leaves, a laser is then shone onto the plant which makes the nanotubes emit an almost infrared fluorescent light that can be detected by an infrared camera which can be placed on a smartphone. Michael Strano, a chemical engineering professor at MIT and leader of the research team, said of his research paper published in Nature Materials: “The goal of plant nanobionics is to introduce nanoparticles into the plant to give it non-native functions.

“This is a novel demonstration of how we have overcome the plant/human communication barrier. “Plants are very good analytical chemists.
