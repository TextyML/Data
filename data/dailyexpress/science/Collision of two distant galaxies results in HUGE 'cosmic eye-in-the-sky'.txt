Astronomers have spotted an eye-in-the-sky some 114million lightyears from Earth which was the result of two galaxies colliding.

Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope – some 66 telescopes in the Chilean desert – experts had spotted that a spiral galaxy dubbed IC 2163 had smashed into a similar galaxy known as NGC 2207.

The collision resulted in a tsunami of stars and swirling carbon monoxide gas which gave the appearance of an eye complete with eyelids.

Lead author of the study published in Astrophysical Journal, Michele Kaufman said: "Although galaxy collisions of this type are not uncommon, only a few galaxies with eye-like, or ocular, structures are known to exist.
