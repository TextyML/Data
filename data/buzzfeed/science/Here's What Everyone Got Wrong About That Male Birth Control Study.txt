3. Hereâ€™s why they actually stopped the study:

BuzzFeed Health talked to one of the study co-authors, Doug Colvard, PhD, deputy director of programs for Conrad (a co-sponsor of the study), for the real story.

At the beginning of the study, an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) was created by the study sponsors. A DSMC is typical in most clinical studies to ensure an independent review of safety. This committee received preliminary data throughout the study to make sure it was all running smoothly. In addition, the researchers also reported every year to a separate review panel within the World Health Organization (WHO).

During one of these regular reviews, the panel noted that certain side effects, especially mood swings and increased libido, were more common than expected. So they decided that the risk of men continuing in the study outweighed the benefits of continuing the study to the end to obtain more complete effectiveness and safety data. They recommended that new participants should not be enrolled and that injections should stop, with all men transitioned to the recovery phase of the trial.
