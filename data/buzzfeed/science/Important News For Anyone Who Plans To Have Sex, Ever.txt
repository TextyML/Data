These included cases of primary and secondary syphilis, which are the first two stages of the infection. These are the stages when most people notice symptoms, like a single sore, multiple sores, or rashes in your mouth, vagina, or anus. You can also get a rash on the bottoms of your hands and feet.

Syphilis is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex when someone has a sore, which can be on the genitals, rectum, anus, mouth, or lips.

Men who have sex with men made up most of the new syphilis cases. The rate of syphilis in women increased by 27% since 2014, and the rate of congenital syphilis (passing it to a baby through childbirth) increased by 6%.
