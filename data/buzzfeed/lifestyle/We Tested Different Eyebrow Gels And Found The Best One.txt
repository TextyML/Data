Nina’s thoughts: I enjoyed this one. It’s not too heavy and does a good job of keeping my brows in place. I don’t think my brows LOOK super different, but they feel like they’re going to keep their shape.

Lara’s thoughts: I really, really liked this one. I would definitely use it again. It felt like something I could easily use every day, and I liked that the brush was so small so I could get more ~artistic~ with it. Also, the colors match my colors well and I appreciate that. Thank you, Benefit.

Alice’s thoughts: This one came in close for first place. The applicator is the same style as the Glossier one and it felt sturdy. The consistency was good and it didn’t feel heavy on my brows. I just wish the handle wasn’t shaped like a cone because it made it awkward to hold.

Sheridan’s thoughts: Wow, I’m surprised by how much I like this! There was a lot of color payoff but it didn’t feel flaky or clumpy. Since I have gaps to fill, I’m always worried about using too much gel because it turns me into Peter Gallagher, without the sexiness. But this struck the right balance for me!

Our overall rating: 4/5
