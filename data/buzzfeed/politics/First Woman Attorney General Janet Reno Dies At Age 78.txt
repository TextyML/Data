7. Born July 21, 1938, Janet Wood Reno was the daughter of two newspaper journalists.

The eldest of four siblings, she grew up on the edge of the Florida Everglades — an area she returned to after leaving Washington, according to AP.

She studied chemistry at Cornell University, and then went on to graduate from Harvard Law School in 1963, becoming one of 16 women to do so that year.

Standing at over six feet tall, Reno later said she wanted to become a lawyer “because I didn’t want people to tell me what to do.”
