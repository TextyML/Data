As election night results revealed a frighteningly close race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , nervous Americans considering an exit strategy apparently crashed Canada’s immigration website.

The site has been working intermittently throughout the night with high levels of traffic. The Huffington Post wasn’t able to reach a representative from Citizenship and Immigration Canada for comment.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau entertained the idea of welcoming Americans fleeing a Trump presidency in March, during a global town hall hosted by HuffPost Canada.

“Cape Breton is lovely, all times of the year,” he said with a smile, referring to a viral website that has encouraged Americans to seek refuge on the small island off Canada’s Atlantic coast should Trump win the election.

Canadians, however, are not keen on the idea. A poll released Tuesday shows the overwhelming majority of the nation is opposed to easing immigration policies in the event of a Trump victory. The poll, conducted by Mainstreet Research and Postmedia Network Inc., also reveals that most Canadians would support Clinton for U.S. president.

“This election has been quite divisive south of the border and many Canadians are anxious about the outcome on Tuesday,” said Quito Maggi, president of Mainstreet Research.
