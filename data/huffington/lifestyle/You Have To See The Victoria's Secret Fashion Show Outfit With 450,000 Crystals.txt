Jasmine Tookes will wear the Fantasy Bra at this year’s Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, but she's not the only model that'll sparkle that night. One of Josephine Skriver's newly-revealed looks will feature 450,000 Swarovski crystals. Mic drop.

Her Swarovski outfit features a show-stopping crop top and thigh-high boots from Brian Atwood, along with the standard bralette and undies. There’s barely an inch of her look that isn’t intricately covered in the clear gems, but the real magic lies in the 3,000 strands of crystals that hang from each sleeve and all down her back, creating a cape-like silhouette.
