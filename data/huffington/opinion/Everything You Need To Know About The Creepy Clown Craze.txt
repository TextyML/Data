While this is one of 2016's most frightening epidemics, creepy clowns are nothing new. Although the exact origins are tough to trace, clown phobias, or coulrophobia, stretch back to the 19th century when they started cropping up in fiction and plays. However, the modern iteration of the evil clown as we known it stems from Stephen King's 1986 novel, "It". It's probably not a coincidence that the book was released a few years after the arrest of the notorious serial killer John Wayne Gacy, who performed as a clown at children's parties.
