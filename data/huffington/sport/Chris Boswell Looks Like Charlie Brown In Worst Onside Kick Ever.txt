While he may have been attempting a tricky onside kick Sunday, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Chris Boswell looked an awful lot like a certain sandlot player from “Peanuts.”

The visiting Steelers were down 21-14 to the Baltimore Ravens with 48 seconds left. Boswell tried a sleight-of-foot maneuver called a “rabona.” It may have been the lamest onside kick attempt in history.
