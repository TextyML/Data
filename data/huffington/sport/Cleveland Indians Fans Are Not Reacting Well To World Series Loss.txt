The 2016 World Series was one for the history books. In Game 7 on Wednesday, the Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 8-7, becoming World Series champions for the first time in 108 years.

Regardless of your team affiliation, it was one thrilling game, with a leadoff homer by the Cubs, a game-tying home run by the Indians in the bottom of the 8th, and an extra-innings victory by one of baseball’s long-running underdogs.

Even though the Indians almost did it, some Cleveland fans are despairing. And rightfully so. The Indians are in a 68-year World Series championship drought ― now the longest of any MLB team, according to SportsCenter.

Below, see some of the best Twitter reactions to Cleveland’s heartbreaking loss.
