Tired of the election? Want to watch an athlete at the top of his game instead?

Stay here a bit. Two-time MVP Stephen Curry broke an NBA record, making 13 three-pointers Monday to lead the Golden State Warriors past the New Orleans Pelicans, 116-106.

He surpassed the single-game record of 12 he had shared with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall after just 17 attempts, scoring 46 points overall. Check out all 13 long-range baskets in the video above.

And to think that just days ago he didnâ€™t sink a single 3 for the first time after 157 games.

Yeah, he can still shoot.
