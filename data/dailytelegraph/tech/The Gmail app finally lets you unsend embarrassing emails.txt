We’ve all been there: a hastily typed-out email has been sent to the wrong person, or worse, hit by an embarrassing spelling mistake thanks to your iPhone's over-enthusiastic autocorrect function.

But Gmail has added a new feature that will spare your blushes. An update to the email service’s iOS app now lets you undo emails you have sent erroneously.

The new feature comes as part of the biggest redesign of the Gmail iPhone app in four years that makes it look similar to the version for Android as well as adding a few new features.
