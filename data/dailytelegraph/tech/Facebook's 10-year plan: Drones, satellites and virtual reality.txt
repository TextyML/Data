Facebook has unveiled its 10 year plan to become more than just a social network, which includes developing social uses for artificial intelligence and virtual reality, as well as launching satellites and drones that can beam internet to earth.

As part of its mission to “connect the world”, the social media giant is working on a standalone VR headset and an AI picture-editing tool that will let users add “intelligent” filters to videos as they film.

Its plan also includes bringing internet access to an extra 4 billion people around the world using its solar-powered, unmanned Aquila drone and a satellite that can beam high-speed internet to far-flung regions.

“Facebook’s mission is to make the world more open and connected,” said Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, outlining the plan at the annual Web Summit conference.
