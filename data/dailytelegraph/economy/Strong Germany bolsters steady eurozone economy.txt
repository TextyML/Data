Companies in the eurozone are growing at their fastest pace since January as German economic growth picked up in the Autumn, according to a set of influential surveys.

Output, orders and hiring are all on the up, firms told IHS Markit’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) survey.

The index rose to 53.3, well above the 50 level that indicates growth.

Although there have been downturns in individual countries in recent years, the overall eurozone economy has been growing since mid-2013 on the index, with both the manufacturing and services sectors currently expanding.
