Factory output increased by 0.6pc in September, beating economists' forecasts of 0.4pc and reversing some of the contraction seen earlier in the summer, according to official figures.

The sector still contracted by 0.9pc in the quarter, though modest growth in August and September could suggest that manufacturers are building momentum.

As a result the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) believes the economy overall grew by 0.4pc in the three months to October, slowing a touch from the 0.5pc in the three months to September.

Private sector surveys have also indicated some pick-up in growth in September and October, with export orders in particular growing.

The Office for National Statistics said that over the past 12 months, however, manufacturing output was only up by 0.2pc as the sector has struggled to grow consistently.
