Canada’s long-awaited and much-delayed trade deal with the EU could be back on the cards at last as Wallonia – the region of Belgium that threw a spanner in the works earlier this month – appears to have decided to back the treaty.

The EU and Canada have been negotiating the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) for seven years, and hoped to sign the deal this month.

But Wallonia withheld its approval, preventing the EU from achieving the unanimous backing of all member nations that it requires.

As a result Canada’s trade minister declared the EU “incapable” of managing international treaties and walked out of talks to return home, while the EU’s President Donald Tusk warned the deal’s collapse could be the end of Brussels’ attempts to strike any trade deals.
