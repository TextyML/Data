The US Federal Reserve held interest rates unchanged on Wednesday despite the strengthening US economy, but indicated that rates could go up after next week's presidential election.

The central bank's rate-setting committee is now widely expected to hike the target for the benchmark federal funds rate from 0.25pc-0.5pc at its next meeting in December, though political uncertainty could push that out into next year.

“The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives,” the Fed said on Wednesday.

“The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2pc inflation.”

Last December the Fed made its first increase in interest rates in almost a decade and indicated it would raise rates several times through 2016.

But slower than expected growth early in the year delayed that plan.
