Britain's jobs market is “thriving” again after a summer dip following the Brexit vote, according to a survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation.

The monthly REC/Markit barometer showed the number of people finding permanent roles climbed at the fastest pace in eight months in October, marking the third consecutive month of increases.

Starting salaries for permanent staff rose at the fastest pace in five months, while vacancies also climbed in October in a sign of increasing employer confidence.

Kevin Green, chief executive of the REC, said: “Despite ongoing uncertainty, the UK jobs market is thriving again in most areas of the UK.”

However, he warned that a chronic skills shortage and concerns that the Government will introduce strict immigration curbs after it leaves the EU presented “real threats” to the ability of businesses to meet demand and the Government to deliver public services.
