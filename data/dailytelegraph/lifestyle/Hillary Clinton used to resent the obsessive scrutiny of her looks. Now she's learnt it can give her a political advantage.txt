Anyone who feels that one cannot discuss Hillary Clinton’s campaign trail make-up without succumbing to the misogyny of those who attempt to reduce her to her appearance need only consider the first televised election debate in September 1960 between Nixon and JFK.

Nixon - who had recently been in hospital - looked pale, exhausted, and unwell. His decision to eschew cosmetics in place of a product called “Lazy Shave,” intended to conceal five o’clock shadow, lead to a sweaty and saturnine appearance under the lights. As Chicago’s mayor, Richard J. Daley, exclaimed: “My God, they’ve embalmed him before he even died.” Kennedy, in contrast, glowed with lusty good health - young, tanned and athletic - like the New England princeling he was. I don't need to tell you who won.

Clinton’s self-presentation has been as vital a part of her campaign as any other candidate’s. More than this, she gets it. A quarter of a century of obsessive scrutiny has made her an adept manipulator of this visual language. Where once she resented the attention, now she exploits and satirises it. As she noted, when her book, Hard Choices, was released in spring 2014, her favourite alternative title had been: The Scrunchie Chronicles, 112 Countries And It’s Still All About The Hair. At the same time, said hair has never looked better, and never seemed more articulate of her coming of age as a candidate.
