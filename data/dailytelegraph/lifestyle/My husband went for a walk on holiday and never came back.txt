After 10 days, the couple’s younger son, Richard, 30, an engineer, had the bright idea to buy a drone to better scour ground that was less easily accessible by foot. After almost three weeks, however, the family returned to the UK, none the wiser.

Today, Armstrong has the look of a woman haunted by grief. Her eyes well with tears but she is determined not to be broken by the weight of either expectation or despair.

“It is pulling us apart,” she says. “We don’t know if he is dead or alive. I think we all fear the worst but there is no proof. There is nothing. I keep asking, 'Dave, if you have died send me a message. Tell me something. I have got to know.’ It is awful. It is eating us up. Danny, Richard and I are in a parallel universe. They are going to work, and that is helping them I think, but our heads are continually somewhere else. All the time I am thinking about him.”

The couple met 40 years ago in Cambridge: Armstrong was working as an art therapist, Wood was doing a PhD. She calls it “friendship at first sight”. It wasn’t until they were both single, five years later, that he dropped everything and travelled to Spain to be with her. After that they “shared everything”.

Theories as to what happened to him abound. Did he fall and hurt himself? Did he have heatstroke and get lost? The possibility that Wood was involved in something dubious has inevitably crossed her mind.
