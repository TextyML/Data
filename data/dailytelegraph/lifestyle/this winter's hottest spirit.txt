As winter warmers go, the Nordics have provided plenty of inspiration, whether it’s nestling in natty knitwear or diving into steamy saunas. But nothing heats the insides quicker than a measure of akvavit (otherwise known as aquavit).

Akvavit is a misunderstood niche spirit and unless you know the Nordic drinking and dining scene, chances are you won’t be familiar with it. Now is the time to try it, particularly since it sits nicely with the region’s fashionable fare.

Akvavit is a spirit distilled with botanicals, most notably caraway and dill. Other ingredients frequently employed include cardamom, cumin, anise, fennel and coriander with lemon or orange peel and even grains of paradise occasionally added.
