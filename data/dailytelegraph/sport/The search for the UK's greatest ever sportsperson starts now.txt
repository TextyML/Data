The minefield of selecting the United Kingdom's all-time top 100 sportsmen and women is tiptoed across with good reason.

This year has proved beyond all challenge that this country is in a golden age across a range of sports that no nation can match for depth or breadth. For that reason, we undertake an audit, to help understand what we most deeply appreciate and why.

One thing we can agree on. As wide as the choice of names is the menu of criteria. When Telegraph Sport reporters began nominating candidates, from W G Grace to the Brownlee brothers, it became obvious that the reasons for choosing this or that athlete were almost as numerous as the contenders themselves.

Our cricket correspondent, Scyld Berry, for instance, argued for W G Grace on the basis that affecting society and changing the game itself is a vital measure.

Naturally there was a tumble of other yardsticks, from pure talent, to longevity, to perseverance, to numerical benchmarks to charisma.

The ability to quell personal demons also popped up as an achievement worth recognising. All the while, the personal memories of each judge were calling up from their well to shape our choices.
