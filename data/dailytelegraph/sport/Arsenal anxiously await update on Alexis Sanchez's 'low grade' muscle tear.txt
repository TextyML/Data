He has not missed a Chile match since March 2013, taking in 50 games. A statement from the Chile FA said that Sanchez would remain with their medics and, according to reports in Chile, he has a nine millimetre tear.

"He will remain in Santiago, under treatment and in evaluation for the meeting against Uruguay," said a statement.

Sanchez, who has scored eight goals for Arsenal this season as their main central striker, played the entire 90 minutes of Sunday’s 1-1 draw against Tottenham. He has also played all 15 of Arsenal’s Premier League and Champions League games this season, even after helping Chile to win the Copa America during the summer.
