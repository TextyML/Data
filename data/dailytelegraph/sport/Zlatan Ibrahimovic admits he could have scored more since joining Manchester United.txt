Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Manchester United striker, has admitted that he should have scored more goals following his move from Paris St. Germain in the summer, though insists he is happy with his performances.

The Swede ended a run of six matches without a goal by scoring twice in Sunday's win at Swansea - his first Premier League goals since finding the net against Manchester City on Sept 10.
