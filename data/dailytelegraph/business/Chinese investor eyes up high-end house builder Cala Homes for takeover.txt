Cala Homes, the UK’s largest private house builder, has been approached by a Chinese company over preliminary takeover talks.

Cala, which is owned by Legal & General and Patron Capital, builds large, high-end homes across the country, in affluent areas in the Midlands, Scotland, and around the M25, in what chief executive Alan Brown described as “Waitrose-type markets”. Its average selling price is £538,000, far higher than the UK average of £202,389.

Sky News reported that China's largest developer, Vanke Group, has been ruled out as the mystery Chinese company which is being advised on the deal by KPMG. Meanwhile L&G and Patron have employed investment bank Lazard to advise them.

A spokesman for Cala said: "Thanks to the quality of our brand and strong financial and trading performance, from time to time we may find ourselves the subject of speculation but from our perspective it is very much business as usual."

Earlier this month, it reported a jump in pre-tax profits by 18pc to £60.1m, with revenue up 15pc to £587.1m. Mr Brown said that while the company eyed up an IPO in 2014, it was not planning to do so in the near future but was focused on reaching a revenue target of £1bn.
