Primark could benefit from a UK outside of the EU if the Government were able to negotiate tariff-free trade deals with countries such as Sri Lanka, which is a big manufacturer of clothing, its boss has said.

George Weston, chief executive of Associated British Foods, the FTSE 100 food and retail giant that owns Primark, said the referendum result had thrown up a number of mixed opportunities and threats.

For Primark, he said it would be beneficial if certain tariffs imposed on clothes imported from Sri Lanka - on which the EU currently levies an 11pc import charge - were axed. In other places, such as Bangladesh, he said retaining tariff-free imports would be welcome.

“The EU has chosen to support manufacturing industries in some countries but not others,” he said.
