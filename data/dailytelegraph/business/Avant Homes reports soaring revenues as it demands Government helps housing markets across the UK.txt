Avant Homes, a privately-owned house builder, has reported a 43pc boost in revenues as the chief executive demanded the Chancellor use the Autumn Statement to help the whole UK housing market, not just the South-east.

Revenues stood at £160m for the six months to October 31, and operating profit is believed to have increased by over 75pc to around £16m in the same period.

Avant builds high-end family homes in the north of England, Scotland, and the Midlands. The average asking price of one of its homes is £246,000, which has increased 16pc in the last six months. This is above the median value of a home in the UK.

The group reported a record number of sales in this six-month period, and said there was "no discernible impact" flowing from the EU referendum result on the company, with its strongest selling months in August and September.

Its focus away from the volatile development markets of London and the South-east means that it sells largely to families, or second-time buyers, who need to move into a bigger home, and are less swayed by political uncertainty.

Colin Lewis, the chief executive, urged Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, to focus on housing policy and infrastructure, such as high-speed rail and better motorways, across the country when he presents his first Autumn Statement on November 23.

He said: “Despite this strong trading, continuing macroeconomic uncertainty remains and I would therefore urge the Government to utilise the forthcoming Autumn Statement to set out its plans to support the UK housing market.

“These plans must acknowledge the multifaceted natured of the UK housing market with a view to supporting the entire UK industry, not just those developers who operate in the South-east.”

Avant completed 721 homes in the six months to October, but has an internal target of building 2,000 homes per year.
