It is supposed to be stored in a labelled jar which is then kept inside an outer jar topped up with water as a precaution.

The advisory note said Cleapss had “recently received a number of calls regarding the chemical”.

And a warning on the Cleapss website read: “If there is no water in the outer container or the reagent bottle has not been placed inside an additional container you must assume that the material has dried out, meaning that an additional risk is present.”

Dr Dave Kinnson, a chemistry safety adviser from the University of Southampton, told BBC Radio 4: “It’s used to test carbonyl compounds and in the school labs it is often used as part of the A-level programmes.

“We’ve always known if this material is not stored properly and allowed to dry out it could become dangerous and could become explosive. But if it’s kept wet it is perfectly safe.

“I think the fuss has started because schools have checked their stocks and are following advice. If they have found stock which could have dried up they are taking precautions. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”

On Monday, The Thomas Adams School in Wem, Shropshire came under fire from local residents after it blew up the chemicals on its playing field without providing a warning of the blast.

One resident complained on the school’s Facebook page that the noise was “immense” and “worrying”, especially when families were out celebrating Halloween.
