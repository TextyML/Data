There's lots of other moons too

Full moon: We all know what these are. They come around every month and light up the night at night.

Harvest moon: The full moon closest to the autumn equinox.

Black moon: Most experts agree that this refers to the second new moon in a calendar month. The last black moon was at the start of October 2016 and the next one is expected in 2019.

Blue moon: A phenomenon that occurs when there is a second full moon in one calendar month. Joe Rao from space.com explains: "A second full moon in a single calendar month is sometimes called a blue moon. A black moon is supposedly the flip side of a blue moon; the second new moon in a single calendar month."

The infrequent nature of this lunar event led to the phrase "once in a blue moon" to signify a rare occurrence. It does not actually mean the moon will be blue.

Blood moon: Also known as a supermoon lunar eclipse. It's when the shadow of Earth casts a reddish glow on the moon, the result of a rare combination of an eclipse with the closest full moon of the year. There was one in September 2015, and before that in 1982 but the next one won't be until 2033.

Strawberry moon: A rare event when there's a full moon on the same day as the summer solstice. It happened in June 2016 for the first time since 1967 when 17 hours of sunlight gave way to a bright moonlit sky.

Despite the name, the moon does appear pink or red. The romantic label was coined by the Algonquin tribes of North America who believed Juneâ€™s full moon signalled the beginning of the strawberry picking season.
