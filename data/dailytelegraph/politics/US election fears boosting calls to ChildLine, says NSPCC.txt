The Rise of Donald Trump may have contributed to a spike in the number of British children being counselled for anxiety, new figures from the NSPCC suggest.

The charity said concerns about the state of the world – including, specifically, the US election – were helping drive a spike in calls to its ChildLine service.

In the year to April 2016, ChildLine received 11,706 contacts – either by telephone or online – in which children mentioned anxiety, up 35 per cent on the previous year.

But the rate in the last six months is already 11 per cent higher, with almost 1,100 such contacts a month.

Its new “worries about the world” web page, has already been visited almost 5,000 since it was set up in September.
