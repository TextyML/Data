Raheem Kassam, a former aide to Nigel Farage, has dropped out of the race to become Ukip leader, saying "the path to victory is too narrow".

Mr Kassam told his supporters: "As of today, I am formally suspending my campaign for Ukip leader.

"After much consideration, I have decided not to pursue my campaign to be Ukip leader any further. This was a very difficult decision, and I want to thank everyone who supported me in the process.

"It is a decision I have not taken lightly, but following meetings this weekend I realised the path to victory is too narrow. I would encourage my supporters to back Peter Whittle, who I think would make a fantastic leader of the party."
