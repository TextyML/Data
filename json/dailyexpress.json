", "text": "Telecoms - do fewer complaints mean there's less to complain about?\u00a0\nIf there's one huge monthly outlay for many of us, it's paying for our TV services, landline phones and mobiles and broadband internet.\u00a0\nAll of these forms of communication are so crucial to the way we live our daily lives but they don't come cheap. They probably represent one of the largest chunks of monthly expenditure after our mortgage/rent and electricity/gas bills.\u00a0\nAnd given how much money we are paying for all of these packages, we shouldn't ever have to put up with problems. Resolver.co.uk users regularly get in touch to tell me about issues they are suffering with bad connections, poor customer service or their bills and packages going up in price.\u00a0\nOn the flip side there was actually a recent report from UK communications regulator Ofcom that showed a decline in the number of complaints made between April and June 2016 about these sort of providers.\u00a0\nBut to me that doesn't necessarily mean there is less to complain about. It may simply mean people aren't taking the time to complain, or are finding it hard to do so.\u00a0\nI know from experience - ever since we launched Resolver to make complaining easier - that so many people are put off raising issues because they see it as wasting time, impossible to get satisfaction from big businesses and also complicated to do.\u00a0\nAnd if anyone has ever waited on hold for ages or searched fruitlessly for the right email address to contact, you'll know the frustrations that can be involved. That's exactly why we exist, to get around those problems and make life simpler for everyone with an issue to raise.\u00a0\nOur free and independent template emails do just that and we can see the benefit clearly during 2016 so far. Users of Resolver.co.uk have taken the time to raise 2,600+ issues about TV providers, 2,500+ relating to landline phones, 18,000+ about mobile networks and 14,000+ regarding internet and broadband.\u00a0\nI always remind people that they have far more power than they assume. Big companies can only continue to be big companies if they have customers.. And no-one wants to lose customers due to bad service.\u00a0\nAnd often the only time they hear or know about bad service is when people like you get in touch with them to tell them about it.\u00a0\nSo what can you do to help with that? Here's some of my key tips for dealing with communications providers when you have a problem.\nMake it clear you may leave\u00a0\nDon't wait until the last minute. Know when your contract is up - put it in a diary or calendar - and tell your provider you are thinking of leaving them. They won't want to hear that. But you have no reason to stay loyal unless they are loyal to you back with a decent deal renewal.\nUsually they will offer you some good reasons to stay a customer, especially if you provide quotes from competitors and ask them to match the prices. However, and this is key, you don't have to accept their first offer. Even if they say it is the best possible price they can give you, it isn't always. Always keep negotiating until YOU are happy.\u00a0\nCompare all the alternatives\u00a0\nEvery month, Resolver.co.uk publishes a list of the top companies for customer service to help people like you know which are the best businesses to buy from. This allows you to go off, search out other deals and decide which is right for you based on\u00a0\nprice, reviews, customer feedback and our own independent chart. There's so much competition out there today that you can sometimes find the same deal, or nearly as good, by switching provider.\nAnd that's never as much hassle these days as you believe it to be. Besides, if you can get more for your money as a 'new' customer elsewhere, then it makes total sense even if it means a few days of disruption and some phone calls and forms. That's the only way bad businesses begin to shape up, when they realise they are losing custom.\u00a0\nContact Customer Retention\u00a0\nIn every company of all shapes and sizes, there's a group of people whose one and only job is to keep you happy and keep you as a customer. Don't be afraid to speak to them and move on from Customer Services if the employee there is not giving you what you want.\nYou might even find that they will actually offer you a much better deal than the one already offered by their own colleague in another department. They have far more room to move and ultimately they do not want to lose you. Just be polite and friendly and don't demand. Simply ask for what you want and feel is the best deal and base it on quotes elsewhere or changes in your own circumstances.\u00a0\nKnow your important dates\u00a0\nAlways be careful to never to let a contract 'roll over' into a new period. Sometimes this will mean any special offers you've previously had given to you will be taken off your bill and you'll find you're paying far more with little or no way to get out of the new contract.\nAlways start way ahead of time to be able to negotiate new deals and pricing. You'd be surprised how many people forget this and not all companies will inform you of your impending contract end date or that it is time to renew. Many contracts are continuous and simply roll over unless you make the effort and act to cancel them.\nSo be careful and read all the terms and conditions carefully and check through any letters received in the post or emails arriving in your inbox that you may think are circulars or spam but are actually far more important.\u00a0\nFinally remember this: never be afraid to tell a company if you are not experiencing good enough service or the price is not right for you. You are the customer and you deserve the best. Now go out and get what you're entitled to and that's simply the best deal possible for you personally.\u00a0\n\n", "tags": ["lifestyle"]},

That desperate people have found their calls unanswered is disgraceful.\nCall handlers, who are dealing with nine million calls each year, are dangerously under-resourced.

When it comes to emergency care, people\u2019s lives must never be left to chance and no one should find themselves in a life-threatening situation based on a post-code lottery.\nThis is an issue that could affect every one of us \u2013 999 is a number you never want to use but are always glad to know it is there.\nWe must work to make sure that this service, which we have always been able to rely upon, remains available to anyone who requires it across the country.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRemember when planners swore that the future of warfare would be short, sharp, shock-tactics and \u201casymmetrical warfare\u201d became a byword for slashing conventional forces? You should \u2013 it was only six years ago.\nAnd it\u2019s clearer than ever that other nations weren\u2019t using the same script. Britain pulled tanks out of Germany, axed Nimrod maritime spy planes and shrunk the Royal Navy to its smallest size in history, believing that they wouldn\u2019t be needed to fight jihadis in Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan.\nMeanwhile Russia became the world\u2019s fourth largest defence spender, investing a whopping 7.5 per cent of its GDP to revamp its creaking hardware.\nVladimir Putin is an ex-KGB chief intent on reliving past glories. Despite Crimea and Syria, Russia\u2019s real aim \u2013 like China, also ramping up its navy \u2013 is to become a great maritime power. And the jewel in the crown is its submarine fleet.\nTrue, Britain is awaiting two new aircraft carriers but only one will be used at any one time. When it comes to maritime presence, quantity trumps quality.We need more destroyers and frigates \u2013 and the sailors to crew them.\nThe days when Britannia ruled the waves may be gone but, with the US focused on potential naval conflict with China, never has the need to invest in our Senior Service been more urgent.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPrince Harry deserves much praise for the way he has carved out a role for himself with his charity work, not least through his Invictus Games.\nHe has been rewarded... it was on a visit to Toronto on behalf of the Games that he met Meghan Markle with whom he has found romance. \nEarly days but we wish them both well.\n", "tags": ["opinion"]},

", "text": "The beleaguered Labour leader pounced on the ruling of three judges that Article 50 can only be triggered by the House of Commons to issue an extraordinary four-point blackmail note to the prime minister.\nIn a bombshell intervention the unpopular left-winger said Mrs May will have to accept his demands or face a backbench rebellion which would force her to call a snap general election.\u00a0\nMr Corbyn is insisting that Britain maintains access to the single market, guarantees all EU workers' rights, keeps Brussels laws on consumers and the environment and agrees to pay for any EU capital investment lost by Brexit.\u00a0\nIf Mrs May refuses to accede to all four demands in a binding parliamentary law, he has vowed to build a cabal of Labour, Green, SNP and Remain-backing Tories to block her from activating Article 50.\u00a0\nThe breathtaking blackmail attempt was tonight set to spark fury amongst eurosceptic MPs who have warned that a europhile establishment is trying to betray the public and reverse the result of June's referendum. \u00a0\nIn a dynamite interview with the Sunday Mirror the embattled Islington MP called the four huge demands his party's \u201cBrexit bottom lines\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThese must be the basis of the negotiations. And it doesn\u2019t necessarily cause a delay.\n\u201cThe court has thrown a big spanner in the works by saying Parliament must be consulted. We accept the result of the referendum.\n\u201cWe are not challenging the referendum. We are not calling for a second referendum. We\u2019re calling for market access for British industry to Europe.\u201d\nOn whether Mrs May will accept the extraordinarily brass-necked demand, he added: \u201cSorry, but we live in a democracy and the Government has to be responsive to Parliament. It\u2019s not my timetable so it\u2019s up to her to respond.\u201d\nAnd he was scathing of the PM's handling of the early stages of Brexit, insisting that if she listens to Labour she can get Britain's negotiating strategy back on track.\u00a0\nHe said: \u201cShe has set a timetable that can easily be achieved.\n\u201cShe just has to set out the negotiating basis which she refuses to do.\n\u201cI would have set out very quickly the relationship with Europe.\n\u201cIt would have stemmed the run on the Pound if we had made clear we wanted to maintain market access to Europe.\u201d\nMr Corbyn's hand has been significantly strengthened by Thursday's ruling that the PM cannot use royal prerogative powers, but must instead consult parliament before activating divorce talks with Brussels.\u00a0\nThe Government has vowed to appeal the decision but legal experts have indicated it is watertight, meaning the prime minister now faces the prospect of having to get Brexit past an incredibly europhile House of Commons.\u00a0\nThe PM has a wafer-thin majority of just 12 and could be forced to call a snap general election if parliament tries to throw a spanner in the work, despite promising not to hold another national vote until 2020.\u00a0\nAnd Mr Corbyn, who according to the latest polls is currently the public's third pick to be the next prime minister - behind Mrs May and 'don't know' - said he is relishing the prospect of an election campaign.\u00a0\nHe said: \u201cIf the Government calls an election we\u2019re ready for it.\n\u201cWe have the members, the organisation and the enthusiasm. We welcome the challenge.\n\u201cIt would give us the chance to put before the British people an alternative economic strategy for this country.\u201d\nThe latest polling by YouGov revealed that just 16 per cent of the British public believe Mr Corbyn would make the best prime minister, compared to 36 per cent who plumped for 'don't know' and 47 per cent who backed Mrs May.\u00a0\nAnd a new ICM poll released earlier this week showed that Labour is on just 27 per cent of the vote nationwide, an astonishing 16 point behind the Tories.\u00a0\n", "tags": ["politics"]},

I like the fact I don\u2019t get treated any different to anybody else.\u201d\nHe had already won the US Open junior championship the previous year but was just about to enter the national conscience permanently with a run to the third round of Wimbledon.\nMurray\u2019s first visit to SW19 was also mine and after a thrilling Saturday afternoon five-setter against David Nalbandian, his life had changed forever.\nHe took his final bow from the tournament that year with ignominious exit in the first round of the mixed doubles on a packed Court Three a couple of days later but already the awkward 18-year-old sensed the difference.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting so many people when I got off court,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move at all.

His fitness was in his control, and Murray fixated on becoming the most athletic player on the tour.\nMental strength was harder to garner but under the tutelage of Ivan Lendl he slowly equipped himself with the tools to win the crunch points.\nOlympic gold in 2012 provided the final piece of the jigsaw \u2013 a belief he could win things. Three weeks after Murray had cried following defeat to Roger Federer at the Wimbledon final, the main focus of the nation had turned to the Olympic Park and the rowing lake.\nBut those lucky enough to attend the raucous circus that sprung up on Centre Court finally saw Murray at his best, beating both Federer and Novak Djokovic to capture honour for his country as much as himself. That victory paved the way for him to end Britain\u2019s 77-year Wimbledon hoodoo and a similar-length drought in the Davis Cup.\nThe fact he had been born a week apart from Djokovic, though, seemed cruel barrier to that elusive no. 1 spot.\nFatherhood, though, gave Murray a fresh perspective. The fact he felt he could go out and celebrate his second Wimbledon triumph with a few rare glasses of bubbly this summer \u2013 in the company of journalists, no less \u2013 showed he had finally discovered greater confidence in himself as a person. He could be his own man.\nNow his near invincibility since that night at Drama nightclub in the heart of the West End has finally catapulted him to the very top of his game.\nHe had given up his social life, worked hard on his fitness, seen the physios, spoken to the sports psychologists and travelled the world. Finally, he had that true belief in himself.\nAmong the many tributes to pour in was a short tweet from Federer himself \u2013 World No.1 for a record 302 weeks.\n\u201cWe have a new king in town. Congrats Sir Andy Murray,\u201d he wrote.\nThe Swiss, like Smith all those years ago, appreciates just how big his achievement is.\n", "tags": ["sport"]},
