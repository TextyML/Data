If it changes, it will be the game-changer.\"\nFormer England footballer Lianne Sanderson, who is also gay, also gave evidence to the committee and said one Premier League player coming out would spark \"a domino effect\" that would lead to others following suit.\nFootball Association chairman Greg Clarke has said the sport must do more to provide an environment in which gay players feel comfortable to come out.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, 2% of men identify themselves as gay, which would equate to about 20 Premier League footballers, based on 20 teams with 25-man first-team squads.\nBosworth told MPs he had suffered abuse on social media after revealing his engagement to his partner during the Rio Olympics.\nHe said abuse on social media \"can be a killer\" and admitted he should have reported some comments to the police but didn't.\nHe added that his partner was sent a homophobic message, written on a swastika, in the post.\nAmaechi, born in the US but educated in Stockport, described social media trolls as \"terrorists who are not worthy of participating in public discourse\".\nHe also revealed he received around \"two death threats a year\", which were sent to either his or his sister's house.\n"},

{"tags": ["tech"], "abstract": "Key swing states are using outdated and insecure voting systems, a source of much concern for cybersecurity experts on polling day.", "title": "US election: Experts keep watch over 'hack states' - BBC News", "text": "The concern that the 2016 US presidential election may be hacked, by Russia or some other bad actor, could hold the same place in history as the Millennium Bug: a whole load of worry over nothing.\n\"Unless the election is extraordinarily close, it is unlikely that an attack will result in the wrong candidate getting elected,\" suggest Matt Bernhard and Professor J Alex Halderman, security experts from the University of Michigan. \nBut they say the risk the election process could be disrupted by hackers should be taken extremely seriously. \nIn the run-up to the big day, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been carrying out \"cyber hygiene\" tests on voting systems across the country. Officials are confident in the technology, but there are weaknesses that have security professionals standing by on election day ready to step in if irregularities are spotted. \nThe task facing any hacker isn\u2019t insignificant. In the US, voting is done via electronic booths, the vast majority of which are not connected to the internet. \nFurthermore, different states, and areas within those states, use different systems - a logistical headache but something of a security godsend, as a fractured system is much harder to attack en masse. \nBut any would-be election hacker wouldn\u2019t need to target the whole country, or even an entire state. Instead, finding methods to implant minute differences, in areas which promise to be a close-run battle, could both affect the national picture and be difficult to detect. \nAnd so just as candidates target swing states that could go either way, so too could hackers be looking at \"hack states\" to target. \n\"Two out of the last four presidential elections were so close that a change of a few counties in one state would have changed the result of the national presidential election,\" said Andrew Appel, professor of computer science at Princeton University, in an interview with BBC News. \n\"It\u2019s not necessary to cheat in 9,000 different jurisdictions. If the election is close in just one state, changing several tens of thousands of votes might be enough.\" \nProf Appel is part of a team of cybersecurity experts that will be working together on Tuesday to advise election officials on cybersecurity-related matters - helping to identify genuine attacks from, say, just your bog-standard computer glitch, of which there may be plenty. \n\"There may be questions about some piece of machinery that is showing some symptom,\" he explained. \n\"Does that look like a hack or is that normal? That kind of question.\" \nAny security audit, whether it\u2019s to protect a company or a property, focuses on the points of weakness. And in this election, the points of weakness are the electronic voting booths. \nThe greatest concern of the group, which is mostly a mixture of academics and security professionals, is that the security in place on voting machines in some crucial areas just isn't up to scratch. \nFor starters, 10 states use touchscreen-only voting machines, an immediate concern.\n\"You touch the screen and indicate the candidate you want,\u201d explained Prof Appel. \n\"There\u2019s no paper involved, and at the end of the day it indicates how many votes the candidate got. There would be no way to tell if it was done fraudulently.\" \nSeveral security experts have demonstrated how this process can be tampered with, by installing malicious software capable of changing a switching a person's vote once it is in the machine, or by spoofing the smart cards used to identify a voter.\nOther states use what\u2019s known as optical scan voting. That\u2019s when a voter fills in a little oval on a page to cast their ballot. It\u2019s logged by the computer, to make counting much quicker, but also stored as a hard copy. If the computer says the vote goes a certain way and there\u2019s suspicion of shenanigans, it can be crossed checked against the paper copy. \nSo where are the \u201chack states\u201d? \nVerified Voting is an organisation that tracks the use of voting machines, and their security, across the US. It\u2019s a painstakingly put together dataset which gives you an idea of the complexity of the US voting system. \nBy using this resource, and combining it with polling data, Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman were able to isolate key states with both poor voting booth security and a tight race. \nThey named the states most at risk as Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Colorado. \n\"As jurisdictions with close races are most vulnerable to having their results perturbed or cast into doubt, these are the ones to be concerned about,\u201d the researchers wrote. \nMost experts are in agreement that the voting machines provide the biggest risk - the key under the mat for anyone looking for a way in. \nBut hackers may look to other means to agitate the process. \n\"A well resourced adversary, for instance a foreign government, could do plenty of other things to disrupt the election,\u201d wrote Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman. \n\"Cutting the power to a few key precincts could throw the entire election into chaos.\" \nFurthermore, Prof Appel pointed to previous incidents in which voter registration databases were breached. In September, the FBI urged districts to work with the DHS to ensure their database systems were secure. \n\"The thing that could go wrong is that a voter could show up at the polling place and be told they\u2019re not listed when in fact they should be listed,\u201d Prof Appel explained. \nIn concluding their data analysis on the at-risk states, Mr Bernhard and Prof Halderman offered a summary. \n\u201cThe 2016 election is less secure than it should be. \n\"While we think it\u2019s unlikely that hackers will be able to silently change who wins, attacks that attempt to disrupt or discredit the electoral process in critical states are a distinct possibility.\" \non Twitter @DaveLeeBBCon Facebook\n"},

Even against the current uncertain economic backdrop, we expect 2016 earnings to be broadly in line with last year.\"\nITV said advertising revenues fell about 11% in October after a jump in the same month last year when it benefitted from the Rugby World Cup.\nThe group boosted viewing figures, with the main ITV channel's share of viewing up 3%. Its online viewing jumped 49% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2016.\nITV's share price rose 1% in early trading, which analysts said was probably due to the revenue fall not being as bad as many experts had forecast.\nTamsin Garrity, media analyst at Jefferies, said the figures were \"slightly better than our cautious scenario\", having pencilled in a drop of more than 8% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nMeanwhile, George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Given the current economic uncertainty, it may not be much of a surprise to see the group's customers are pulling their horns in, but it is still not good news for the group. \n\"For the time being, ITV remains the prime place to advertise on a national scale. Coronation Street's status as a national treasure isn't endangered by a weaker economy. \n\"The challenge for the group now is to retain this premier position as Netflix and others grow in the on-demand sphere. Viewing habits are changing and ITV will have to change with them.\"\n"}
