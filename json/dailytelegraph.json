Politicians in the US have also turned against the idea during the current Presidential election campaign.\nBritain is watching CETA closely as the UK wants to reach a trade agreement with the EU as it leaves the union, but also because the Government wants to do its own post-Brexit deals with countries including Canada.\n"},
{"tags": ["lifestyle"], "title": "Until we treat male and female domestic abuse victims the same, we'll never be rid of it", "abstract": "It was early 1998.", "text": "It was early 1998. I was on a ferry, and on the car radio, an agony aunt was talking to a man who described himself as a six-foot rugby-playing policeman who, for 10 years, had been beaten almost daily by his five-foot-two wife. I vividly remember my \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d response. That actually happens to men?\nI sensed there was a story in this somewhere, and began to research. With surprising ease, I found people who knew a man it had happened to. In fact I had \u2013 and still have \u2013 the same conversation over and over again when I tell people that I have written about this topic. I could script it, and it goes exactly like this\u2026\nAn expert I spoke to in the late 90s\u00a0opined that the situation for male victims then was much the same as it had been for women thirty years earlier. Around the same time, a senior policeman told me that we shouldn\u2019t talk about male victims for fear that it takes the focus away from women.\nI continued to research, speaking to both male and female victims and found that just as the types of abuse reported by men are similar to the types of abuse reported by women, the impact of that abuse is much the same. What appears to be different is an unwillingness on the part of many men to accept that what has happened is actually abuse, many of them seeing it as something \u201cthat just happens\u201d.\nPart of male socialisation and the sexist stereotypes society imposes on our men and boys is to \u201cgrow a pair\u201d, \u201cman up\u201d, or \u201ctake it like a man\u201d. Therefore, it could be argued, men\u2019s weakness is their fa\u00e7ade of strength.\nAccording to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and the 2014/15 British Crime Survey, male victims (29pc) are more than twice as likely as women (12pc) to not tell anyone about the partner abuse they are experiencing, and only 10% of male victims will tell the police (26pc\u00a0women). These figures show that domestic abuse is, in general, underreported, and that surely calls into question the current trend towards a gendered approach.\nOver the years that I\u2019ve been observing this issue, the conversation has moved from being about domestic abuse to stopping violence against women and children. A laudable aim, for who in their right mind wouldn\u2019t want that to happen? My concern \u2013 and one that is shared by people who work with abused men \u2013 is that it appears that in this narrative male victims are being sidelined.\nIn 2015, 109,000 men reported to English and Welsh police forces that they were victims of domestic abuse, which constitutes 23pc of the overall total. This is not an insignificant number. Another study found that while men are eight times more likely to commit overall violence than women, there is gender parity in partner abuse. More worrying is the fact that more than 70pc of non-reciprocal violence is instigated by women. Things have changed, and not in a good way.\nGiven that the research indicates only 12% of male victims contact the police, it's probably\u00a0safe to assume the real figures are greater.\u00a0 Take those numbers and consider the help available for men. Twenty organisations offer refuge or safe house provision for male victims in the UK \u2013 a total of 82 spaces, of which 24 are dedicated to male DV victims only (the rest being for victims of either gender). For female victims, there close to 7,500 spaces for women and their children.\nSo where do we as a society go from here? We need an open and honest debate. We need to encourage all victims to come forward and seek help. We need to acknowledge that the barriers abused men face are not only attributable to a lack of visible and accessible support services, and the marginalisation of men in the public narrative of domestic abuse, but are also related to sexist stereotypes of what it means to be a \u201creal man\u201d.\nI believe we need to follow the lead of the female victims of domestic abuse who have come to me after reading my novel,\u00a0A Suitable Lie. They see this book as a commentary on domestic abuse and the horrors it inflicts. What they\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0see is gender. They see violence and its impact; they feel listened to; and they feel hope that together \u2013 women and men \u2013 we can rid our society of this scourge.\nPerhaps that generosity of spirit and empathy is where the experts need to go. Because, while they argue about who is doing what to whom and in what numbers,\u00a0people\u00a0are being hurt by other\u00a0people. And\u00a0people\u00a0and their children are not receiving the help and support they need.\nA Suitable Lie is published by Orenda Books, \u00a38.99\n"},

But Bernard-Henri Levy, writing dispatches from the front line of the battle for Mosul, is not unusual. Kurdish Peshmerga units are full of embedded Western journalists and this isn\u2019t a coincidence. It\u2019s a canny move by the Kurdish Regional Government in Erbil to ensure the world knows about the Kurds\u2019 role in the offensive to retake Mosul, Iraq\u2019s third city, from Isil.\nYet while it makes for good reading, the bravery of the Kurdish Peshmerga (\u201cthose who stand in the face of death\u201d) forces is not actually the most notable aspect of the operation. More remarkable is the level of cooperation between the Kurds troops and the Iraqi national army.\nTwo years after Iraq\u2019s military turned tail and fled Mosul, leaving its residents to suffer under Isil\u2019s black flags, the same force is now leading the charge to retake the city. Better still, the operation has warmed relations between Baghdad and Kurdish leaders. The entente is fragile, but if it can hold, a stable Iraq might just emerge.\nThe operation has been set up carefully, with Western help. Iraqi troops have promised to stay in line and respect Kurdish territory. In turn, the Peshmerga have promised they won\u2019t enter Mosul. That part was easy, says Mike Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute, because the Kurds have no desire to repeat the mistakes made in 2003, when they conquered Mosul from Sunni Baathists, looted everything then tried to rule over a hostile population.\nThis time, the Kurds have their eyes on a bigger prize. In August, Erbil and Baghdad finally signed a deal to share revenues from oil production around Kirkuk, a city home to a large Kurdish population \u2013 and Iraq\u2019s richest oil reserves. Erbil badly needs the cash: since oil prices plunged, the Kurdish government has only been able to pay about half of the wages owed to its bloated civil service, according to Renad Mansour of Chatham House.\nIn Kirkuk, a special accommodation has been reached. Baghdad pays the salaries and the Peshmerga provide the security. Oil revenues are split fifty-fifty. That might not be a glorious step towards the independence the Kurds crave, but until an upturn in the oil price, that ambition is on the back burner. In addition to the oil deal, Baghdad has also been sharing Western-provided weaponry with the Peshmerga and including Kurdish officials in international summits.\nThe Mosul offensive is helping to strengthen this trust, but victory in the battle will bring two dangers. With Isil defeated, there will be a power vacuum in the city. Two other players will be trying to influence what happens next: Mosul\u2019s Sunni population and Iraq\u2019s Shia militias, who have mostly been kept out of the battle so far.\nMosul\u2019s Sunnis could make a strong case to be given more autonomy, along the lines of Kurdish Iraq. Iraq\u2019s constitution in theory grants them a large degree of self-governance, but it was never honoured by the previous regime in Baghdad. The city has been through hell under Isil and the coming battle could be even worse. It\u2019s also home to many former Baathists who supported Saddam Hussein. So even if they are granted more autonomy, it\u2019s not clear how its factions will agree to share power peacefully.\nAn even bigger challenge are the Shia militias. These bands are full of extremist, anti-Sunni soldiers and are backed by Iran, which is working to keep Iraq weak and unstable. If Iran gets its way and can boost the power of its cronies in Baghdad, led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, Iraq could fall back into chaos.\nAvoiding this fate will take patience, military strength and clever strategy. The West must keep together its coalition of European and US forces aiding Iraq\u2019s shaky government. But it must also help persuade Baghdad to accept reality and give the country\u2019s Sunnis more autonomy in a proper federal system. In order to hold Iraq together, its leaders must be prepared to split it up.\nThis will take years, not months, but it\u2019s a prize worth fighting for. If Iraq\u2019s sects and ethnic groups can find a way to share power, the country could become an example to the whole region. And as for Isil, which is about to lose the self-declared capital of its gruesome caliphate, it may simply collapse into the discarded wreckage of history where it belongs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"},

Sadly, however - and for the first time in five editions - there were no female sailors departing from Les Sables d\u2019Olonne on Sunday morning.\nIt is a huge shame. You think about some of the famous women who have competed in past editions; Isabelle Autissier, Catherine Chabaud, Sam Davies. Most of all Ellen Macarthur, of course, who as a 24 year-old finished second back in 2001, still the best ever result by a British sailor in the Vend\u00e9e Globe and one that made her a household name on both sides of the Channel, earning her the nickname \u2018la petite anglaise'.\nSo why are there no female sailors in this race?\nRest assured it has nothing to do with the physical nature of the event. In my opinion, the appetite is there, but timing plays an important role. Many of those who might have considered entering were part of Team SCA, the first all-female Volvo Ocean Race Team in over a decade. There simply wasn\u2019t the time to put a challenge together after last year's Volvo Ocean Race.\nI am, though, confident we will see plenty of women in the next edition. There were five female sailors in this year\u2019s La Solitaire du Figaro, which is seen as the feeder series to the Vend\u00e9e Globe. I think at least three of them could enter in 2020, and I know there are others who would love another crack, including me. Who knows what the future may hold.\nIt actually feels odd for this Vend\u00e9e Globe not to feature any women because in many ways female sailing is riding the crest of a wave at the moment. The new CEO of the Volvo Ocean Race, Mark Turner, has introduced bold new rules incentivising teams to sail mixed, while as well as Team SCA in the Volvo Ocean Race we recently saw the first all-female team compete in the Extreme Sailing Series.\nAll this is happening at a time when UKSA, the Cowes-based charity, has moved to address a gender imbalance in the sport which sees fewer women taking up its courses than men and still fewer going on to work in the industry.\nThe Women into Sailing careers initiative was launched during Cowes Week this year and I was delighted to play a part. As a proud UKSA ambassador, and a graduate of one of the its professional training courses, I look forward to seeing the next generation of female sailors coming through.\nThis is a key moment. Women\u2019s sport is taking off and we do not want sailing to be left behind.\n\u00a0\nDee Caffari finished\u00a0sixth in the 2008-2009 Vendee Globe becoming in the process the first woman to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in both directions.\n"},
